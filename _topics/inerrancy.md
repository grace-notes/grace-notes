**Inerrancy 3**

The Inerrancy of the Bible

**Inerrancy** is a word which describes the concept of the complete
accuracy and truthfulness of the Bible as the Word of God. When we say
that the Bible is “inerrant”, we mean that the Bible is wholly true,
that it was given by God to the original authors in such a way that it
is without error and is free from untruth.

The authority of Scripture is a key issue for the Christian church in
this age, as it has been in every age. Christian believers are called
upon to show the reality of their discipleship by humbly and faithfully
obeying God’s written Word. Therefore, recognition of the total
trustworthiness of Scripture is essential to a full and adequate
confession of its authority.

There is a continuous attack on the Word of God and its place as the
authoritative representation of the mind of God on earth. This attack is
orchestrated by Satan himself as part of the spiritual conflict. The
following paragraphs state the position of fundamental believers on the
question of the authority of the Bible.

Inerrancy is not negated by Biblical phenomena such as a lack of modern technical precision, irregularities of grammar or spelling, observational descriptions of nature, the reporting of falsehoods, the use of hyperbole and round numbers, the topical arrangement of material, variant selections of material in parallel accounts, or the use of free citations.</p></td>
