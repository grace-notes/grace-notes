> _“The Christian who does not understand what God has done in the past, and does not have faith in what God will do in the future, will be overwhelmed by today’s crisis.”_ __Chester McCalley__


Your Christian life began the moment you believed the Gospel, putting your complete confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation. At that moment, God provided you with a great number of unique and permanent blessings. _“…and hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”_ ([Eph. 1:3] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Eph.+1%3A3)) These blessings are a part of your inheritance as a Christian; they are the doctrines and promises upon which you may draw during the remainder of your lifetime.

The following is a listing of salvation doctrines, a catalogue of the things God did for you when you accepted Christ. These basic teachings are the underlying principles for the mechanics of Christian living, the techniques such as faith rest and occupation with Christ, and are foundation principles for all other Bible doctrine.

This listing can provide you with hours of quality study and meditation. You may well find other topics that could be added to the list. It is valuable and important that you understand thoroughly your relationship with the Lord; a good knowledge of these doctrines can be of great help to you in solving problems and making decisions according to God’s viewpoint.

You are **in the eternal plan of God**, sharing the destiny of the Lord Jesus Christ. As such you are:

**Foreknown**

* **[Acts 2:23] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+2%3A23)**. _this Man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him to death._

* **[Romans 8:29] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A29)**. _For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren;_

* **[1 Peter 1:2] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A2&)**. _according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure._

**Elect**

* **[Romans 8:33] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A33)**. _Who will bring a charge against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies;_

* **[Colossians 3:12] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A12)**. _So, as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved, put on a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience;_

* **[1 Thessalonians 1:4] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+1%3A4)**. _knowing, brethren beloved by God, His choice of you;_

* **[Titus 1:1] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Titus+1%3A1)**. _Paul, a bond-servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,_

* **[1 Peter 1:1, 2] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A1-2)**. _Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who reside as aliens, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, who are chosen_

**Predestined**

* **[Romans 8:29, 30] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A29-30)**. _For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to the image of His Son, so that *He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified._

* **[Ephesians 1:5] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A5).** _He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will_

* **[Ephesians 1:11] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A11)**. _also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His will,_

**Called**

* **[1 Thessalonians 5:24] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A24)**. _Faithful is He who calls you, and He also will bring it to pass._

You have been **reconciled** …

**Reconciled by God**

* **[2 Corinthians 5:18] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A18)**. _Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,_

* **[Colossians 1:20] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A20)**. _and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven._

**Reconciled to God**

* **[Romans 5:10] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A10)**. _For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life._

* **[2 Corinthians 5:20] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A20)**. _Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God._

* **[Ephesians 2:14-16] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+2%3A14-16)**. _For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, by abolishing in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity._

**You have been _redeemed_** (purchased from the slave market of sin).

* **[Romans 3:24] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A24)**. _being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus;_

* **[Colossians 1:14] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+1%3A14&)**. _in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins._

* **[1 Peter 1:18] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A18)**. _knowing that you were not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inherited from your forefathers,_

* **[Ephesians 1:7] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7)**. _In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace_

You have been **removed from condemnation.**

* **[John 3:18] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3%3A18)**. _He who believes in Him is not judged; he who does not believe has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God._

* **[John 5:24] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+5%3A24)**. _Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life._

* **[Romans 8:1] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A1)**. _Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus._

You are **under grace** _and not under judgment (doctrine of propitiation)._

* **[Romans 3:24–28] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+3%3A24%E2%80%9328)**. _being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus; whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law._

* **[1 John 2:2] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2%3A2)**. _and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world._

Your **sins have been judged** by the spiritual death of Christ on the cross:

* **[Ephesians 1:7] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+1%3A7)**. _In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace_

* **[1 Peter 2:24] (http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A24)**. _and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed._

You have been made **dead to the old life and alive unto God**. You are:

**Crucified with Christ**

* **[Romans 6:6] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A6)**. _knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;_

* **[Galatians 2:20] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+2%3A20)**. _I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me._

**Dead with Christ**

* **[Romans 6:8] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A8)**. _Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,_

* **[Colossians 3:3] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A3)**. _For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God._

* **[1 Peter 2:24] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+2%3A24)**. _and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed._

** Buried with Christ**

* **[Romans 6:4] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A4)**. _Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life._

* **[Colossians 2:12] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+2%3A12)**. _having been buried with Him in baptism, in which you were also raised up with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead._

** Risen with Christ**

* **[Romans 6:4] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A4)**. _Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life._

* **[Colossians 3:1] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Colossians+3%3A1)**. Therefore if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.

You are **free from the law**.

* **[Romans 6:14] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6%3A14)**. _For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace._

* **[Romans 7:4-6] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A4-6)**. _Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God. For while we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were aroused by the Law, were at work in the members of our body to bear fruit for death. But now we have been released from the Law, having died to that by which we were bound, so that we serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter._

* **[2 Corinthians 3:11] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+3%3A11)**. _For if that which fades away was with glory, much more that which remains is in glory._

* **[Galatians 3:25] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3%3A25)**. _But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor [the Law]._

You have been **adopted** (placed as an adult heir in the family of God)

* **[Romans 8:15] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A15)**. _For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!”_

* **[Romans 8:23] (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8%3A23)**. _And not only this, but also we ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body._

* **1 Corinthians 6:11**. _Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God._

* **1 John 3:2**. Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not appeared as yet what we will be. We know that when He appears, we will be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is.

### New Creations

* **2 Corinthians 5:17**. Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away; behold, new things have come.

* **1 Peter 2:5**. you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

To make a believer acceptable to Himself, God sees to it that you have been:

whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so
also should you.

* **Ephesians 2:13,19**. But now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. **19** So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints, and are of God’s household,

* **Philippians 3:20**. For our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;

#### You have been **delivered from the kingdom of Satan**.

* **Colossians 1:13**. For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,

Holy Father, keep them in Your name, the name which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We are. **12** While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be fulfilled. **24** Father, I desire that they also, whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am, so that they may see My glory which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.

#### You have been **delivered from the power of the sin nature**.

* **Romans 2:29**. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that which is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from men, but from God.

darkness into His marvelous light;

Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. **16** Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

* **Hebrews 10:19,20**. Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,

#### You are **within the much more care of God.**

### Objects of His love

* **Ephesians 2:4**. But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,

* **Ephesians 5:2**. and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.

* **For keeping**, **Romans 5:2**. and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma.

**For instruction**, **Titus 2:12**. instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age,

### Objects of His power

* **Ephesians 1:19**. and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of the strength of His might

* **Philippians 2:13**. for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure.

### Objects of His faithfulness

* **Philippians 1:6**. For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.

* **Hebrews 13:5**. Make sure that your character is free from the love of money, being content with what you have; for He Himself has said, “I will never desert you, nor will I ever forsake you,”

### Objects of His peace

* **John 14:27**. Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.

### Objects of His consolation

* **2 Thessalonians 2:16**. Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope by grace,

### Objects of His intercession

* **Romans 8:34**. who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.

* **Romans 7:25**. Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.

* **Romans 9:24**. even us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles.

#### You are a beneficiary of the inheritance from God (**an heir of God and a joint-heir with the Lord Jesus Christ**).

* **Romans 8:17**. and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified with Him.

* **Ephesians 1:14,18.**who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory. **18** I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you will know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints,

* **Colossians 3:24**. knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve.

* **Hebrews 9:15**. For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.

* **1 Peter 1:4**. to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,

#### You have a **new position in Christ**.

* **Ephesians 2:6**. and raised us up with Him, and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,

* **Colossians 3:4**. When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with Him in glory.

* **1 Corinthians 1:9**. God is faithful, through whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
