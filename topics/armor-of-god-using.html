<p>Vegetius: <strong>If training in arms ceases, there is no difference between a soldier and a civilian!</strong> and <strong><em>No matter how many years he has served, an unexercised solder is a raw&nbsp;recruit!</em></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes at the end of a Bible class, Pastor Bob Bolender tells us in the congregation to &#x201C;Keep Your Armor On&#x201D;, reminding us of the apostle Paul&#x2019;s exhortation in Ephesians&nbsp;6:10-17.</p>
<p>Spiritual armor consists of several distinct articles of defensive and offensive equipment, each piece of which has its special features requiring thorough and consistent training in its&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>The Christian who is to be fully armored and trained for spiritual combat must fully understand several&nbsp;things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>What the armor of God is.</strong><br> What are the individual pieces of equipment, for both defense and&nbsp;attack?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How each piece of the armor of God is to be &#x201C;put on&#x201D;.</strong><br> For example, what is put on first, then next? How are the pieces joined together and attached for maximum&nbsp;security?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How each piece of the armor is to be employed.</strong><br> What training is required, both for self defense and for offensive&nbsp;action?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It doesn&#x2019;t help us much if we say &#x201C;Yes, Pastor, I will keep my armor on&#x201D;, if we aren&#x2019;t thoroughly skilled in its use and continuously being trained in fighting&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<p>The article that I have pasted in below, about the training of Roman soldiers, shows you the kinds of things that Paul had in mind when he wrote about the armor of God. He knew then, as we know now, that <strong>spiritual warfare is vicious, unforgiving, no-holds-barred combat</strong> that makes casualties of the unprepared. We see them falling around us every&nbsp;day!</p>
<p>The ABC Grace Notes library of Bible studies has many doctrinal articles that help us learn how to use the armor of God. There are now more than 400 categorical studies in the library, and many of them contribute directly or indirectly to proficiency in using the armor of God. <strong>Click here</strong> for a listing of available&nbsp;materials.</p>
<p>Some key doctrines&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>Faith, Faith-Rest, Armor of God (exposition of Eph. 6:10-17), Salvation Doctrines, Positional Truth, Imputation, Satan, Demons, Mental Attitude, Occupation with Christ, Prayer, Evil. You can probably think of many more doctrines that are&nbsp;applicable.</p>

<p>From Publius Flavius <strong>Vegetius</strong> Renatus, <em>Epitome of Military Science (The Military Institutions of the Romans)</em>[Let me know if you would like a PDF copy of the&nbsp;book.]</p>
<p>Recruits and novice soldiers are trained morning and afternoon in all types of arms; but veterans and trained soldiers also exercised with their arms once a day without fail. <em>For length of service or number of years does not transmit the art of war, but continual exercise</em>. <strong><em>No matter how many years he has served, an unexercised solder is a raw&nbsp;recruit.</em></strong></p>
<p>Special drill (<em>armatura</em>), [mock battles. wd] which is displayed on festival days in the Circus [Maximus] is learned not just by the soldiers under the drillmaster, but by all soldiers alike in daily practice. For speed is acquired by bodily exercise itself, and also the skill to strike the enemy while covering oneself, especially in close-quarter sword fighting. What is more, they learn how to keep ranks and follow their ensign through such complicated evolutions in the mock-battle itself. No deviation arises among trained men, however great the confusion of&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>It is also very useful for them to exercise with the [sword and striking post] because they learn to go for the flank, feet, or head with the point and with the edge. Let them grow used to executing jumps and blows at the same time, rushing at the shield with a leap and crouching down again, now eagerly darting forward with a bound, now giving ground, jumping back. Let them also practice hitting the same posts from a distance with javelins, to increase their skill at aiming and the strength of the right&nbsp;arm.</p>
<p>Archers and slingers put up bundles of brushwood or straw (<em>scopae</em>), for a target, removing themselves 600 feet from the target, to practice hitting it frequently with arrows, or stones aimed from a sling staff (<em>fustibalis</em>). This enabled them to do without nerves in battle what they had always done in exercises on the training&nbsp;field.</p>
<p>They should also be accustomed to rotating the sling once only about the head, when the stone is discharged from it. All soldiers also practice throwing stones of one pound weight (about 11 &#xBD; ounces) by hand alone. This is considered a readier method because it does not require a&nbsp;sling.</p>
<p>They are also made to thrown javelins and lead-weighted darts in continual and perpetual exercises; so much so, that in winter-time they build riding-schools for the cavalry and a kind of drill hall for the infantry, roofed with tiles or shingles, or, failing these, thatched with reeds, sedge, or straw. In them the army was trained in arms under cover, when the weather was disturbed by wind or rain. But for the rest of the time, even in winter, so soon as snow and rain ceased, they are made to train on the exercise-field, so that no interruption to routine might weaken soldiers&#x2019; minds and&nbsp;bodies.</p>
<p>It is advisable that they should very frequently be felling trees, carrying burdens, jumping ditches, swimming in the sea or rivers, marching at full step, or even running with their [weapons], with their packs on, that the habit of daily labor may not then seem arduous in war. Whether they be legion or [auxiliary troops], let them be training constantly. As a well-drilled soldier looks forward to battle, so an untrained one fears&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Finally, note that technical skill is more useful in battle than strength. <strong>If training in arms ceases, there is no difference between a soldier and a&nbsp;civilian.</strong></p>

Pastor-Teachers and church education leaders use Grace Notes for their basic training curriculum for educating pastors, evangelists, teachers of adults and children, and church administrators.</p>
<p>Grace Notes offers twelve (12) Units of course work, each unit roughly analogous to a semester of Bible College instruction. Students can earn certificates for each course completed, <a href="http://www.gracenotes.info/DiplomaCourses.shtml">Unit certificates, and Diplomas</a> for completing various portions of the curriculum.</p>
