          <section class="content"><p>The Word of God is&nbsp;TRUTH</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life, no man comes unto the Father but by me” (John 14:6) Any desire to be occupied with Christ, and to serve Him, must be accompanied by a great desire for the truth, the Word of God. The acquiring of truth must be the highest&nbsp;priority.</p>
<p>There are many Bible passages that deal with the concept of truth; here is a&nbsp;sampling:</p>
<p>Psalm 86:11, “Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth; unite my heart to fear thy&nbsp;name.</p>
<p>Psalm 119:72, “The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.” Also Psalm&nbsp;119:127,162.</p>
<p>Prov. 23:23, “Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and&nbsp;understanding.”</p>
<p>Examples of eagerness for&nbsp;truth:</p>
<p><strong>The temple&nbsp;worshippers:</strong></p>
<p>Luke 21:37, 38 “Now during the day He was teaching in the temple, but at evening He would go out and spend the night on the mount that is called Olivet. And all the people would get up early in the morning to come to Him in the temple to listen to&nbsp;Him.</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Samaritans:</strong></p>
<p>John 4:39-42, “And from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified,”He told me all the things that I have done.&quot; So when the Samaritans came to Him, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days. And many more believed because of His word; and they were saying to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves and know that this One is indeed the Savior of the&nbsp;world.”</p>
<p><strong>Cornelius:</strong></p>
<p>Acts 10:30-33 And Cornelius said, “Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments, and he said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. Send therefore to Joppa and invite Simon, who is also called Peter, to come to you; he is staying at the house of Simon the tanner by the sea.’”And so I sent to you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now then, we are all here present before God to hear all that you have been commanded by the&nbsp;Lord.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Bereans:</strong></p>
<p>Acts 17:10-13, “And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea; and when they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews. Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so. Many of them therefore believed, along with a number of prominent Greek women and men. But when the Jews of Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there likewise, agitating and stirring up the&nbsp;crowds.</p>
<p><strong>Other passages to&nbsp;read:</strong></p>
<p>Col. 1:9-23;&nbsp;2:1-8</p>
<p>Eph. 1:17-23; 3:14-19;&nbsp;4:11-16.</p>
