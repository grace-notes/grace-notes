          <section class="content"><p>We have an inheritance from God the Father because we share the destiny of Christ. The main feature of the doctrine of predestination is that we share Christ’s&nbsp;destiny.</p>
<p><strong>Eph. 1:11,</strong> “also we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His purpose who works all things after the counsel of His&nbsp;will,”</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, as the Son of God, and as the victor in the spiritual conflict, is the heir of all things. Heb.&nbsp;1:1-4</p>
<p>Inheritance is based on son&nbsp;ship:</p>
<p><strong>John 1:12</strong>, “But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believe in His&nbsp;name,”</p>
<p><strong>Rom. 8:16, 17</strong>, “The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of&nbsp;God,”</p>
<p>“and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him in order that we may also be glorified with&nbsp;Him.”</p>
<p><strong>Gal. 3:26-29</strong>, “For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ&nbsp;Jesus.”</p>
<p>“For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with&nbsp;Christ.”</p>
<p>“There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ&nbsp;Jesus.”</p>
<p>“And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to&nbsp;promise.”</p>
<p>To inherit from God, a person must possess the life of God, that is, salvation resulting in eternal&nbsp;life.</p>
<p><strong>Titus 3:5-7</strong>, “He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy&nbsp;Spirit,”</p>
<p>“whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our&nbsp;Savior,”</p>
<p>“that being justified by His grace we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal&nbsp;life.”</p>
<p><strong>1 John 5:11, 12</strong>, “And the witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His&nbsp;Son.”</p>
<p>“He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the&nbsp;life.”</p>
<p>Therefore, salvation is the qualification for inheriting from God. Col.&nbsp;1:9-14</p>
<p>As joint heirs with Christ, we also share Christ’s&nbsp;election.</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 9:15</strong>, “And for this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal&nbsp;inheritance.”</p>
<p>Our heritage is related to the doctrine of eternal&nbsp;security.</p>
<p><strong>1 Pet. 1:3-5</strong>, “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the&nbsp;dead,”</p>
<p>“to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for&nbsp;you,”</p>
<p>“who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last&nbsp;time.”</p>
<p>The indwelling of the Holy Spirit is the down payment on our inheritance. Eph.&nbsp;1:14</p>
<p>Abraham’s inheritance is the pattern and illustration of the heritage of believers as described in Romans&nbsp;4:9-16.</p>
