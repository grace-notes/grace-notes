          <section class="content"><p>by Pastor Mark&nbsp;Perkins</p>
<p>In order to understand a book of the Bible written by a prophet, we must first come to an understanding of the message and role of the&nbsp;prophet.</p>
<p>The purpose of prophecy was to communicate the message of God to the people of&nbsp;Israel.</p>
<p>• The prophet received his inspiration from God the Holy&nbsp;Spirit.</p>
<p>• The prophet communicated in the written mode, and indeed the Old Testament canon of Scripture was written entirely by men with either the gift or office of&nbsp;prophecy.</p>
<p>• Prophets were responsible for the communication of the ritual plan of God. All of the information concerning the system of feasts, sacrifices, and the tabernacle/temple was communicated through&nbsp;prophets.</p>
<p>• Prophets were also responsible for the spoken communication, which interpreted the symbology of the ritual&nbsp;system.</p>
<ul>
<li>The priests did not hold this responsibility. Their job was to go through the ritual system exactly as&nbsp;prescribed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture tells the Levites to do, do, do, hundreds of times. But they do not ever tell them to&nbsp;interpret.</p>
<p>The prophets communicated the ritual plan of God, and they interpreted it as well. They were the ones who told the people what it all&nbsp;meant.</p>
<p>Prophecy would also fill in the gaps left by the ritual&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>• Whereas the ritual system communicated truth about God and His plan for Israel, the prophet would communicate something more&nbsp;pertinent.</p>
<p>• The message was pertinent for the person or people for whom it was&nbsp;intended.</p>
<p>• The message was appropriate to the time in which it was&nbsp;spoken.</p>
<p>• Whereas the ritual system was not behavior specific, prophecy&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>The nature of prophecy is&nbsp;twofold.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To interpret historical trends, and to tell the people where those trends are leading. This is called&nbsp;‘forthtelling’.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to understand that events in this category do not have to come to&nbsp;pass.</p>
<p>Many of the future events related are contingent upon the fulfillment of some&nbsp;condition.</p>
<p>The future of these events which are forthtold is still dependent upon human&nbsp;volition.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>To relate with perfect accuracy certain future events which relate to the nation of Israel. This is called&nbsp;‘foretelling’.</li>
</ol>
<p>The predicted events still remain pertinent to the time in which they were&nbsp;predicted.</p>
<p>In other words, there is always a message for the present time in the prediction of the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Even though the events predicted may not come to pass for hundreds, or even thousands of years, they have some impact, some bearing on the people to whom they were&nbsp;predicted.</p>
<p>Our understanding of the events of the tribulation and millennium have an impact on how we conduct our lives&nbsp;today.</p>
<p>Understanding the tribulation gives us an idea of the consequences of giving in to the cosmic system, for the tribulation reveals the cosmic system in its unrestrained&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>Understanding the millennium gives us an idea of the consequences of living according to the laws of Divine establishment, for the millennium reveals the kingdom of God in its full&nbsp;glory.</p>
<p>There is a difference between the gift of prophet and the office of&nbsp;prophet.</p>
<p>• The office of prophet was an appointed post in the nation of&nbsp;Israel.</p>
<p>Those who served in the office of prophet functioned exclusively in the communication of prophetic&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>There are two categories of Old Testament writings written by those who had the office of prophet. All together, this part is called “The&nbsp;Prophets”.</p>
<p>The “former” prophets wrote the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and&nbsp;Kings.</p>
<p>The “latter” prophets wrote the books of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the minor&nbsp;prophets.</p>
<p>The one in the office of prophet did not hold another job, but instead, prophecy was his&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>• The gift of prophecy was an ability given by God to prophesy to one who did not hold the office of&nbsp;prophet.</p>
<p>When God had something to say to His people, but the office of prophet was vacant or spiritually bankrupt He gave to a few people the gift of&nbsp;prophet.</p>
<p>These people received direct revelation from God, which led to their communication to the&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>There are three parts to the Old Testament written by those with the gift of prophecy. All together, this was called “The&nbsp;Writings”.</p>
<p>The prophetical books include Psalms, Proverbs, and&nbsp;Job.</p>
<p>The Megalith included those books which were read at the feasts. The Song of Solomon was read at Passover. Ruth was read at Pentecost. Lamentations and Ecclesiastes were read during Tabernacles. Esther was read at&nbsp;Purim.</p>
<p>The historical books include Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and&nbsp;Chronicles.</p>
<p>• Moses had both the gift and the office of prophet. He wrote the Pentateuch, which contained the first five books of the Bible, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, and Numbers. He had both because his role in life changed from time to&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>• Elisha and Elijah held the office of prophet, but did not write. The important parts of their ministries are recorded by other writers of&nbsp;Scripture.</p>
<p>The nature of prophetic&nbsp;inspiration</p>
<p>• The prophet was inspired according to the standard of verbal plenary&nbsp;inspiration.</p>
<p>• The prophet was always aware of his&nbsp;inspiration.</p>
<p>The Word of the Lord came to him (many&nbsp;times).</p>
<p>God’s hand touched his mouth, Jer&nbsp;1:9.</p>
<p>He was standing in God’s counsel, Jer&nbsp;23:22.</p>
<p>• The inspiration always came by the Spirit, Num 24:2; 11:29; 1 Sam 10:6,10; 19:20,23; 1 Ki 22:24; Joel 2:28-29, Hosea 9:7, “The days of punishment are coming, the days of reckoning are at hand. Let Israel know this. Because your sins are so many and your hostility so great, the prophet is considered a fool, the inspired man a&nbsp;maniac.”</p>
<p>• The intermediate means were&nbsp;many.</p>
<p>Life experience,&nbsp;Hosea.</p>
<p>A visible symbol, Amos&nbsp;7:7.</p>
<p>A dream (the subconscious mind, while asleep), Jer&nbsp;31:26.</p>
<p>A vision (the conscious mind, while awake),&nbsp;Zechariah.</p>
<p>Direct teaching from God, Isaiah&nbsp;6.</p>
<p>The interpretation of historical trends from Bible Truth in the right lobe of the&nbsp;soul.</p>
<p>From training, 1 Sam 10:5, “After that you will go to Gibeah of God, where there is a Philistine outpost. As you approach the town, you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres, tambourines, flutes and harps being played before them, and they will be&nbsp;prophesying.”</p>
<p>• The exhale of the&nbsp;prophet.</p>
<p>He explained the meaning of the ritual&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>He used the parable, or allegory. Hosea 6:4, “What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that&nbsp;disappears.”</p>
<p>He acted his message out in order to graphically illustrate&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>He foretold certain future events, all of which had a relevant message during his&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>These prophecies now stand in two&nbsp;categories:</p>
<p>Those which have been fulfilled - for example, more than 300 related to the life of&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>Those which have yet to be fulfilled - for example, the book of Revelation, and parts of Daniel, Ezekiel, and other&nbsp;prophets.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>• The Old Testament prophet was the rough equivalent of the New Testament&nbsp;pastor.</p>
<p>• He interpreted God’s Word, he exhorted the people, he observed and interpreted historical&nbsp;trends.</p>
<p>• He was, however, different in a few&nbsp;ways:</p>
<p>He had a lesser understanding of the full revelation of God, Mat 13:17, “For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear&nbsp;it.”</p>
<p>This is because of the age in which he&nbsp;lived.</p>
<p>This is because he lived before the incarnation of&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>He did not have the gift inside of himself, as those with the gift of pastor&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>He did not have the full-time availability of the power of the Spirit, but instead he only had it for the purpose of&nbsp;prophecy.</p>
<p>He had the power to foretell certain future&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>• The Old Testament prophet was the one who brought the Word to the people, the one who made it clear to them. The priests did nothing of the&nbsp;sort.</p>
<p>• The Old Testament prophet had the supernatural ability to foretell certain future&nbsp;events.</p>
