          <section class="content"><p>Each member of the Trinity is related to the body of Christ, and every Christian is a part of the body of&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>God the Father placed Christ as the head of the&nbsp;body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eph. 1:22,23</strong>, “And hath put all things under His feet, and gave Him too be the head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him that fills all in&nbsp;all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Col. 1:18,19; Eph. 5:23,24</strong> also fit this&nbsp;context.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit forms the body of Christ and sustains the&nbsp;body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 12:12-14</strong>, “For as the body in one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. For by one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Greeks, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but&nbsp;many.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 6:15; 19,20</strong> support this&nbsp;statement.</p>
<p>Christ is the Savior of the&nbsp;body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eph. 5:23</strong>, “For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ the head of the church; and He is the savior of the&nbsp;body.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please read <strong>Eph. 5:25, 30</strong>.</p>
<p>Christ is the sanctifier of the&nbsp;body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heb. 2:11</strong>, “For both He that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them&nbsp;brethren.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heb. 13:12</strong>, “Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered outside the&nbsp;gate.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of Christ participates with the Lord Jesus Christ in tactical and strategic victory over Satan and his forces of&nbsp;evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eph. 1:22,23</strong>, “And has put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be the head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him that fills all in&nbsp;all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every Christian is a member of the body of Christ. The body includes gentile believers and Jewish&nbsp;believers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ephesians 2:16</strong>, “And that He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity&nbsp;thereby.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The body of Christ is the recipient of many spiritual&nbsp;gifts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rom. 12:4,5</strong>, “For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of&nbsp;another.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 12:7,8</strong>, “But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit. For to one is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom, to another, the word of knowledge, by the same&nbsp;Spirit;”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The communication of Bible truth is the responsibility of the body of Christ and of those people given communication&nbsp;gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Eph. 4:11</strong> and the following verses describe the process of church building through communication of doctrine. This is discussed in the Ephesians course for chapter&nbsp;4.</p>
<p>The objective of the body in this life is to live the grace filled&nbsp;life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eph. 4:15,16</strong>, “But, speaking the truth in love, may grow up into Him in all things, who is the head, even Christ; from whom the whole body, fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according tot he effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in&nbsp;love.”</p>
</blockquote>
