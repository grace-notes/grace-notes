      <h1>Loyal Love</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="content">

        <article class="article">
          <section class="content"><p>by Glenn Carnagey,&nbsp;PhD</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This is a study of the Bible doctrine of Loyal Love, taken from the Hebrew words CHASAD, CHESED and&nbsp;CHASIYD.</p></li>
<li><p>In its concrete earliest application as a noun, the Hebrew word CHASIYD, means “stork”. It used in the Bible as a reference to the intense and total loyalty of the stork to its offspring, especially that of the mother stork, hence the concept of Loyal&nbsp;Love.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Moses listed the Stork as among the unclean birds not to be eaten by the&nbsp;Jews.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two basic varieties of&nbsp;Storks:</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>the Black Stork (Ciconia Nigra)&nbsp;and</p></li>
<li><p>the White Stork (Ciconia&nbsp;Alba).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>They are noted both for their high flight and for their powerful wings (as used for an analogy with angel wings, Zech 5:9), and for their total devotion to their&nbsp;young.</p></li>
<li><p>Although normally considered to be a Marsh Bird, storks nest in the trees for maximum safety, as in the Fir trees of Lebanon. Ps&nbsp;104:17</p></li>
<li><p>Their life cycle is rigidly regular, with a precise migration pattern to Northern Europe and back to the Middle East. Jer 8:7. They are definitely&nbsp;pluggers!!</p></li>
<li><p>Because of their close family loyalty, these Birds became proverbial for exhibiting parental love and loyalty, and thus they gave rise to the myth that storks deliver human&nbsp;babies.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>As a noun, when CHESED is applied to God, the concept originates from God’s&nbsp;Attributes.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It is most closely associated with God’s veracity or truth, EMET, with which the Holy Spirit connects it some twelve&nbsp;times.</p></li>
<li><p>The motivation to Loyal Love is Love, expressed by the Hebrew term “tender mercies”, or RACHMIM in&nbsp;Hebrew.</p></li>
<li><p>The skeleton of Loyal Love is Immutability or EMUNAH, the concept that God never changes throughout&nbsp;Eternity.</p></li>
<li><p>Loyal Love is the Counterpart of God’s justice,&nbsp;MISHPAT.</p></li>
<li><p>God’s Loyal Love is primarily extended to those who have acquired the perfect righteousness of God through Faith&nbsp;(TSIDKENAH).</p></li>
<li><p>loyal love and goodness are companions to all believers living the Christian Way of&nbsp;Life.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>The concepts bound up in God’s Loyal Love by God are illustrated in Hosea&nbsp;2:19-21.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus, as an integral part of God’s innate Essence and Attributes, CHESED is vast in&nbsp;extent.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Endless extent in&nbsp;time.</p></li>
<li><p>Endless extent in&nbsp;space.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlimited extent in&nbsp;value</p></li>
<li><p>Great in&nbsp;quantity.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>God’s Loyal Love is applied to man as “expressed love” in three ways with reference to application of Love to&nbsp;Men.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>As covenants or&nbsp;contracts.</p></li>
<li><p>As covenant acts of loyalty to the&nbsp;nation.</p></li>
<li><p>As contract acts of loyalty to&nbsp;individuals.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>God’s CHESED is the basis of all protection for the believer in time and in eternity, and is the source of the reverse mantle of cursing on the enemies of the mature&nbsp;believer.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>God’s loyal love is the hedge which functions as the protection of the believer against the hatred of the satanic forces in time in the spiritual&nbsp;warfare.</p></li>
<li><p>It also provides the wall of fire around the nation of&nbsp;Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>From God’s loyal love flow all the blessings of the glory&nbsp;spectrum.</p></li>
<li><p>To the antagonists of the mature believer god molds an anti-mantle or a mantle of&nbsp;cursing.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>In line with God’s provision for man’s protection stands the application of CHESED through the laws of divine&nbsp;establishment.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Volition: God’s loyal love protects the volition of the&nbsp;believer.</p></li>
<li><p>Marriage: Through divine redemption God insures that compatible marriage partners find each&nbsp;other.</p></li>
<li><p>Family: There really isn’t any generation gap if the generations grow to maturity by God’s grace&nbsp;provisions.</p></li>
<li><p>National Entities: People are to be loyal to the king or&nbsp;government.</p></li>
<li><p>The mark of a break-down of the laws of divine establishment in a nation is the loss of freedom in which the CHASIDIM (Loyal Ones) are persecuted, murdered and robbed, while with the government protecting the&nbsp;crooks.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Moses formulated a battle cry of loyal love, which must be the hallmark and Standard of any Priest-Nation, in order to accomplish National&nbsp;Survival.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Moses originally formulated the concept by portraying God as a warrior leading his nation to&nbsp;freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>God could also be represented by the Shekinah Glory leading the&nbsp;nation.</p></li>
<li><p>The Ark of the Covenant later substituted for the Shekinah Glory (The Lord Jesus&nbsp;Christ).</p></li>
<li>DAVID combined all of these together into the Psalm of the Ark&nbsp;(Psalm</li>
</ol>
<ol start="139" type="1">
<li>in the form of the battle cry of loyal love. I Chron. 16:34 &amp;&nbsp;41</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="a">
<li>SOLOMON reinstituted and repeated his father’s Psalm of the Ark and instructed his Temple Musicians to sing it during the dedication of the Temple. They were singing it when the Shekinah Glory appeared over the&nbsp;Temple.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The first statement of the battle cry was during the music that was played before Solomon’s sermon while the articles of furniture, including the Ark, were being installed into the Temple. II Chron&nbsp;5:13-14</p></li>
<li><p>The second repetition of the battle cry came after Solomon had completed his Bible class and closing prayer of dedication, when the fire of god came down and consumed the sacrifices. The people echoed the battle cry here. II Chron&nbsp;7:3,6</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="a">
<li>The other poets of Psalms picked up the battle cry and made it a major theme with variations in their praises to&nbsp;God.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>As an introduction to a Psalm, showing all the facets of national and individual life affected by God’s Loyal Love. Ps.&nbsp;107:1</p></li>
<li><p>As an introduction to a Psalm recounting the events of the exodus and the negative volition of the Jews during those times. Ps.&nbsp;106:1</p></li>
<li><p>As a frame of a section of a Psalm, containing Laws of Divine Establishment information approving of military victory for the nation that serves God. Ps.&nbsp;118:1-4,29</p></li>
<li><p>As a refrain repeated over and over to emphasize the continuous Loyal Love of God during the events of the Exodus. Ps&nbsp;136:1-26.</p></li>
<li><p>As the climax of a Psalm of praise, almost as a doxology. Ps. 100:5; Ps&nbsp;138:8</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="7" type="a">
<li><p>Based on his personal doctrinal knowledge that the Ark of the Covenant led the troops to battle in the days of Moses, Joshua and The Judges, and Jehoshaphat appointed singers to sing the Song of the Ark as the army fought the Ammonite-Moabite-Edomite coalition. Hence the battle cry became an integral part of battle strategy for the nation of Israel. II Chron.&nbsp;20:21</p></li>
<li><p>During the spiritually degenerating generations just before the exile, Jeremiah prophesied a coming generation which would again be positive and obedient enough to use the Battle Cry of Loyal Love. Jer.&nbsp;33:11</p></li>
<li><p>When the Foundation of the Post-Exilic Temple was laid under Ezra, the priests again sang the Psalm of the Ark and quoted the battle cry in victorious exultation. Ezra&nbsp;3:11</p></li>
<li><p>Thus the Battle Cry of Loyal Love becomes an appropriate slogan for the saints of all ages who recognize their role in the Angelic Conflict (spiritual&nbsp;warfare).</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>In much the same way that God suggests that His justice should inspire believers to respond with just behavior, so he demonstrates that His loyalty should produce loyalty in us (justice demands justice; loyal love demands loyal love) in all spheres of human&nbsp;relationships.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li>God desires a response of loyalty to Himself, His Word, and His communicators of the Word of&nbsp;God.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>God knows all believers who rely on His loyal love. Ps&nbsp;33:18</p></li>
<li><p>As Believers Grow, GOD takes pleasure in those who continually depend upon His loyal love. Ps&nbsp;147:11</p></li>
<li><p>God desires two things from believers: loyal love and knowledge of doctrine. Hosea&nbsp;6:6</p></li>
<li><p>The Lord commands His children to develop loyal love. Hosea 10:12 and&nbsp;12:7</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to respond to God’s Loyal Love with your own Loyal Love constitutes A legal breach of contract. Hosea&nbsp;4:1</p></li>
<li><p>Believers fail to respond properly to God because of the short duration of their loyal love towards God. Isaiah 40:5; Hosea&nbsp;6:4</p></li>
<li><p>God honors past generations who operated on loyal love and prophesies a future generation which will do the same. Jeremiah 2:2; Hosea&nbsp;2:19</p></li>
<li><p>Believers then are commemorated in scripture for their response to God’s Loyal Love with Loyal Love of their&nbsp;own.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>David and Solomon - II Chronicles&nbsp;6:42</p></li>
<li><p>Hezekiah - II Chronicles&nbsp;32:32</p></li>
<li><p>Josiah - II Chronicles&nbsp;35:26</p></li>
<li><p>Nehemiah - Nehemiah&nbsp;13;14</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>God Demands Loyal Love between husband and&nbsp;wife.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>God sets the Pattern by His Loyal Love to Israel. Hosea&nbsp;2:19</p></li>
<li><p>Husband to Wife: Xerxes to Esther. Esther 2:9;&nbsp;2:17</p></li>
<li><p>Wife to&nbsp;Husband.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Ruth and Orpah to Mahlon and Chilion - Ruth&nbsp;1:8</p></li>
<li><p>Ruth to Boaz - Ruth&nbsp;3:10</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>This is God’s pattern for us even if your spouse is a royal jerk!!! Genesis&nbsp;20:13</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>However, loyal love of friend to friend is given more biblical space than ALL the others combined and is found throughout the Old&nbsp;Testament.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li>FRIENDSHIP LOYAL&nbsp;LOVE.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Loyal Love involves Loyal Love for your friend equal to the love we have for ourselves ( and we all have that!). I Sam 20:17; Prov&nbsp;11:17</p></li>
<li><p>Thus a true friend will stand by his friend under any test and do whatever is necessary for his friend’s well being. I Samuel 20:4; Job&nbsp;6:14</p></li>
<li><p>True friendship love includes speaking truth to your friend, even if it is highly unpleasant. Genesis 21:25; Psalm&nbsp;141:5</p></li>
<li><p>Loyal Love in Friendship demands total honesty of action as well as words, and extends even to the point of execution for crime if guilty. I Samuel&nbsp;20:8</p></li>
<li><p>The friendship Loyal Love is based on both friends having a covenant relationship with YAHWEH, thus fulfilling the Principle: Loyalty Demand Loyalty. I Samuel&nbsp;20:8</p></li>
<li><p>Hence a true friend remains loyal under any crisis of his friend, though that loyalty may demand separation during the period of the friend’s backsliding (reversionism). I Samuel&nbsp;20:9-13</p></li>
<li><p>Even family relationships are subordinated to this loyal love between friends, when the family member is wrong biblically. I Samuel&nbsp;20:12-13</p></li>
<li><p>Loyal love to a friend extends to his children (family) as well as to himself -forever. I Samuel 20:14-15; II Samuel&nbsp;9:13</p></li>
<li><p>This loyal love is totally devoid of jealousy, hence it involves the ability to shift from first place to second place if the friend is divinely promoted without jealousy or rancor. There should be no jealousy or bitterness over a friend’s blessing or promotion. I Samuel&nbsp;20:14-15</p></li>
<li><p>Many acquaintances will trumpet their ostensible loyal love to you, but a truly faithful friend is rare! Proverbs&nbsp;20:6</p></li>
<li><p>Consequently, believers must remain alert and discerning in order to sift between true friends and Jonadabs like Ziba versus&nbsp;Mephibosheth.</p></li>
<li><p>When a Jonadab slanders a friend (Jonadab = a self-seeking ingratiating pseudo-friend), the believer should confront his friend in person to ask for the truth face-to-face without assuming his guilt. II Samuel 9:1; 16:1-4; 19:24;&nbsp;21:7</p></li>

<li>LOYAL LOVE in all love categories is achieved by growing to spiritual&nbsp;maturity.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The younger a person is when he becomes a believer and begins to grow, the longer he has to enjoy God’s Loyal Love; hence, start young! Psalm&nbsp;90:14;</p></li>
<li><p>The believer must stay in fellowship or restore it quickly in order to grow&nbsp;consistently.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Principle: God always forgives when the believer confesses his sin. Psalm&nbsp;90:14</p></li>
<li><p>Moses states the principles that God’s forgiveness is always available. Numbers&nbsp;14:19</p></li>
<li><p>Even when believers must be disciplined, God does so through loyal love, and thus with compassion and applied love. Lam 3:32; Ps&nbsp;106:45</p></li>
<li><p>God’s Loyal Love is the only thing that keeps us alive in spite of sinning habitually. Lamentations&nbsp;3:22</p></li>
<li><p>The best illustration is the life of David; he always acknowledged his sins to God. Psalm 25:7;&nbsp;51:1</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>Believers must be alert and growing tin order to avoid the influence of evil. Proverbs 14:22; Proverbs&nbsp;16:6</p></li>
<li><p>Coupled with rebound or confession of sins must be the protection against the influence of evil, and only consistent daily study of God’s Word will do the&nbsp;job.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Both sin and evil are defeated by means of God’s System for Spiritual Growth. Proverbs&nbsp;16:6</p></li>
<li><p>The Believer must have Positive Volition towards the truth of God’s Word. Psalm&nbsp;119:24</p></li>
<li><p>Bible Doctrine which is appropriated (accepted) flows to the Christian’s memory. Proverbs&nbsp;3:3</p></li>
<li><p>God responds to positive volition on the part of the believer with a process called “quickening” or spiritual growth for the believer. Psalm&nbsp;119:159</p></li>
<li><p>Application of Bible Doctrine into the believer’s life is essential. Psalm&nbsp;25:10</p></li>
<li><p>This Results in the production of divine good (gold, silver, precious stones) in the life of the believer. Psalm&nbsp;14:22</p></li>
<li><p>Tenacious pursuit of God’s path to spiritual growth (the Glory Road) provides maturity and loyalty in all categories of Loyal Love. Proverbs&nbsp;21:21</p></li>
</ol>

<li>The places at which loyal love can be&nbsp;developed.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Doctrine can be studied in God’s classroom (Temple in OT, Local Church in NT). Psalm&nbsp;48:9</p></li>
<li><p>The believer should start his day with doctrine. Psalm&nbsp;143:8</p></li>
<li><p>Loyal Love comforts the believer under testing through God’s Word, acquired via face-to-face teaching. Psalm&nbsp;119:124</p></li>
