          <section class="content"><p><strong>Akra:</strong>The exact location of the Akra is in some doubt. Josephus says that it stood in the Lower City which typically refers to southeastern hill of Jerusalem. Built in 186 B.C., the Akra was a fortress built by the Seleucid ruler of Syria who. It seems to have been built to control the population of Jerusalem proper. It was destroyed in 141 B.C. by Simon&nbsp;Maccabee.</p>
<p><strong>Barclay’s Gate:</strong>Built during the Herodian expansion (19-11 B.C.) Barclay’s Gate was in the southwest corner of the Herodian Temple Mount&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p><strong>Barclay’s Gate:</strong>Built during the Herodian expansion (19-11 B.C.) Barclays Gate was in the southwest corner of the Herodian Temple Mount&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p><strong>Baris:</strong>The Hananeel and Mea Towers were destroyed in 587 B.C. and rebuilt during the Hasmonean period by John Hyrcanus. The twin towers were renamed Baris. They were once again destroyed by Pompey in 63 B.C. and rebuilt by Herod the Great between 37 and 31 B.C. and renamed Antonia after Mark&nbsp;Antony.</p>
<p><strong>Bend in wall:</strong>First noted by the 19th century explorer Charles Warren, the bend in the wall is located near the southeastern corner of the current Temple Mount platform. It apparently marks the southeast corner of the original Temple Mount platform built by&nbsp;Solomon.</p>
<p><strong>Bethesda Valley:</strong>The walled city of Jerusalem was built on a series of hills and valleys which dramatically altered the elevation of the city from one side to the other. The Bethesda Valley was north of the present Temple Mount area. As the city expanded, the Bethesda Valley was incorporated into the walled&nbsp;city.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge:</strong>Extending westward from the West Gate, the bridge was built during the Hasmonean expansion about 141 B.C. Later, during the Herodian Period, the bridge was expanded and an arch was added (Wilson’s&nbsp;Arch).</p>
<p><strong>Dome of the Rock:</strong>Located on the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif), the Dome of the Rock is a magnificent religious structure built by the Moslems in about 691 A.D. by Omayyad Abd al-Malik. The focal point of the Dome is the rock mass (called E1 Sakhra in Arabic) from which, according to tradition, Mohammed ascended into heaven on his horse. In contrast, according to Jewish tradition, the site represents Mount Moriah - where Abraham would have sacrificed his son Isaac had the Lord not intervened and provided a ram for sacrifice (Gen. 22:1-13). According to Moslem tradition, it was Ishmael and not Isaac who was almost&nbsp;sacrificed.</p>
<p><strong>Double Gate:</strong>The Double Gate is so-called because it has two doorways. The Double and Triple Gate at the southern end of the Temple Mount may be named for Huldah the prophetess (2 Kings 22:8-14). The Double and Triple Gates may have been the location of the original entry into the Temple area during Solomon’s time. Like the Triple Gate, this gate provided access to the underground steps which led to the Temple Mount. This gate is now&nbsp;sealed.</p>
<p><strong>Fortress of Antonia:</strong>Built by Herod the Great during the Herodian expansion (19-11 B.C.), this fortress was named by Herod after Mark Antony. It was constructed to defend the Temple precincts on the north where the Temple was the most vulnerable to attack as there were no natural valleys to the north. Stairs connected the fortress to the Temple. It may have been this fortress where Paul was taken when he was arrested (Acts&nbsp;21:30-37).</p>
<p><strong>Fosse:</strong>The fosse was a moat or ditch they lay just northwest of the Temple Mount platform. According to the Greek historian, Strabo, the dry moat was about 60 feet deep and 250 feet wide. The purpose of the moat was to protect the Temple Mount from attack from the north. The Mount was protected by natural valleys on the east south and west, but not on the north. Josephus (antiq. 14.4.2) tells us the moat was filled in by Pompey’s soldiers in 63&nbsp;B.C.</p>
<p><strong>Golden Gate:</strong>This double entrance gate provided entry into the Temple Mount area from the east. This gate is now sealed due to a Muslim belief that someday a conqueror will enter through the gate and destroy the city. The two entries of the gate are called the Gate of Repentance and the Gate of Mercy. Another Muslim belief suggests that this gate will be the first to open before the Messiah on the day of Resurrection. In 1969, after a heavy rainfall, James Fleming fell into an eight foot hole that opened up in front of the Golden Gate. Inside the hole were human bones - an obvious mass grave. Further scrutiny of the open area by Fleming revealed what may have been another gate below the Golden Gate. It is now thought that Jesus may have made his triumphal entry into Jerusalem through an eastern gate - perhaps one just below the Golden Gate because it provided the quickest access to the Temple. The Moslems covered the opening with cement so the site has not been properly excavated and&nbsp;studied.</p>
<p><strong>Hasmonean Addition:</strong>The Hasmoneans under the leadership of John Hyrcanus built the extension of the Temple Mount platform atop the Akra fortress about 141 B.C. To allow entry to the Temple Mount area from the south, a pair of tunnels were built which were later called the Double and Triple&nbsp;Gates.</p>
<p><strong>Herodian Addition:</strong>Herod the Great doubled the size of the Temple Mount area, expanding the Mount to the north, west and south. He could not expand the Mount eastward because of the steep drop to the Kidron Valley. Herod’s expansion included the Pool of Israel and the Antonia Fortress to the north of the Temple Mount. To the west Herod added various archways and gates (Warren’s Gate, Barclay’s Gate, Wilson’s Arch and Robinson’s Arch). To the south, Herod built the Royal Stoa - which Josephus describe as “a structure more worthy of description than any other under the sun” (Antiq.&nbsp;15.11.5).</p>
<p><strong>Huldah Gates:</strong>Apparently named after the prophetess Huldah (2 Kings 22:8-14), the Huldah Gates sat atop stairs on the southern end of Solomon’s Temple Mount platform. Later, after the Hasmonean and Herodian expansion of the Temple Mount platform, tunnels led to the Huldah Gates which may have been renamed the Double&nbsp;Gate.</p>
<p><strong>Islamic Platform:</strong>The Islamic or Muslim platform stands within the 500 x 500 royal cubit Solomonic platform. It is in the northwest corner of the Solomonic platform and is most noted for the Dome of the Rock which predominates the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p><strong>Islamic Platform:</strong>The Islamic or Muslim platform stands within the 500 x 500 royal cubit Solomonic platform. It is in the northwest corner of the Solomonic platform and is most noted for the Dome of the Rock which predominates the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p><strong>Kidron Valley:</strong>This valley was just east of the City of David and modern-day Jerusalem. Through it flowed the brook of Kidron. When Herod the Great expanded the Temple Mount area, he was prevented from expanding it eastward because of the steep drop into the Kidron Valley. There are some Old Testament references to events occurring at or near the Kidron Valley. Asa destroyed Maachah’s idol by burning it by the brook of&nbsp;Kidron</p>
<p><strong>Kidron Valley:</strong>This was the valley just east of the City of David and modern-day Jerusalem through which flowed the brook of Kidron. Asa destroyed Maachah’s idol by burning it by the brook of Kidron (1 Kings 15:13). Similarly, in 2 Kings (2 Kings 23:4), Hilkiah the high priest burned the vessels made for Baal at the brook of Kidron. Located at the bottom of the Kidron Valley was the Gihon Spring which was the only natural source of water for the ancient&nbsp;city.</p>
<p><strong>Mea Tower:</strong>(Meah) The Mea Tower is also known as the Tower of the Hundred (“meah” coming from the Hebrew for “hundred.”). It is first mentioned in the book of Nehemiah in describing the rebuilding of the walls when the remnant of captives returned from captivity (Neh. 3:1; Neh. 12:39). The Mea Tower was destroyed in 587 B.C. and rebuilt during the Hasmonean period by John Hyrcanus. The twin towers Hananeel and Mea were renamed Baris. They were once again destroyed by Pompey in 63 B.C. and rebuilt by Herod the Great between 37 and 31 B.C. and renamed Antonia after mark Antony. Later, when Herod expanded the Temple Mount platform he built a fortress which he called&nbsp;Antonia.</p>
<p><strong>Moriah:</strong>The land of Moriah is mentioned as the place to which Abraham was sent by God to sacrifice his son Isaac (Gen. 22:2-14). Abraham was able to follow the Lord’s instruction, thereby proving his faith, because he knew that God was capable of raising men from the dead (Heb. 11:17-19). God provided a ram for sacrifice instead, sparing Isaac’s life, and Abraham called the place “Jehovahjireh” which means “Jehovah will see to it” (Gen. 22:14). The place is called a “mount,” and is associated with Mt. Moriah which was later to become the site of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. It should be noted that the Moslems believe Abraham was sent to sacrifice Ishmael, not Isaac, despite the biblical&nbsp;record.</p>
<p><strong>Mt. Moriah:</strong>Mt. Moriah is the hill to which Abraham went to sacrifice his son Isaac. Abraham called the place “Jehovahjireh” which means “Jehovah will see to it” (Gen. 22:14). The place is called a “mount,” and is Mt. Moriah which was later to become the site of the Holy Temple in Jerusalem. Mt. Moriah was the site of the building of the Temple by Solomon (2 Chron. 3:1). It is sometimes referred to as the Temple Mount, though the Temple Mount has also come to mean the walled area upon which the Temple sat. David had prepared the site for the Temple construction on what had been the threshing floor of Ornan the&nbsp;Jebusite.</p>
<p><strong>Olivet:</strong>Olivet, otherwise known as the mount of olives, was a hill east of Jerusalem. The Kidron Valley lay between the city of Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives. David worshiped God on the Mount of Olives (2 Sam. 15:30-32). The prophet Zechariah describes the destruction of Jerusalem and alludes to the Messiah in the area of the Mount of Olives (tech. 14:1-11). Jesus ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives (Acts&nbsp;1:9-12).</p>
<p><strong>Outline of Present Temple Mount:</strong>During Herod the Great’s rule (37 - 4 B.C.), he doubled the size of the Temple Mount by extending it in all directions except eastward because of the precipitous drop down into the Kidron Valley. Today’s Temple Mount area is essentially the same as that constructed by Herod, except that many walls and gates have been&nbsp;rebuilt.</p>
<p><strong>Pool of Israel:</strong>The Pool of Israel was a large, open reservoir for water that had a capacity of over 22 million gallons. Since water was in short supply in the vicinity of Jerusalem, many cisterns and reservoirs were built around and in the&nbsp;city.</p>
<p><strong>Prison Gate:</strong>Located at the north end of the original Temple Mount, the Prison Gate is mentioned only one time in the old Testament (Neh.&nbsp;12:39).</p>
<p><strong>Robinson’s Arch:</strong>This is the name given to the arch which at one time protruded from the wall of the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount. It was named after a 19th century orientalist Edward Robinson. It is now thought that the arch supported a&nbsp;staircase.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Stoa:</strong>The Royal Stoa - a hall of immense proportions was the location of the Sanhedrin as well as other government functions. Two rows of columns (40 each) divided the stoa into 3 halls. Excavations of the site confirm Josephus’ assessment of the stoa as a place of great&nbsp;beauty.</p>
<p><strong>Solomon’s Porch:</strong>Solomon’s Porch was on the east side of the courtyard adjacent to the many porticoes surrounding the courtyard. Jesus walked in Solomon’s Porch (John 10:23); Peter and John healed a lame man at Solomon’s Porch (Acts 3:1-11); the early church met on Solomon’s Porch (Acts&nbsp;5:12).</p>
<p><strong>Solomon’s Temple Mount:</strong>The Temple Mount platform was the site upon which the Temple was built by Solomon. It has been suggested by archaeologists that the platform was 500 by 500 cubits square. Since a royal cubit measured about 20.67 inches, Solomon’s Temple Mount platform, it is estimated, was about 861 feet square. The Bible does not provide information about the platform size itself. The 500 cubit square dimension comes from a tractate of the Mishnah called Middot (Middot 2:1) and speaks of the repaired platform upon the return of the Israelites from Babylonian captivity. This map shows the location of the Temple Mount platform as suggested by Leen Ritmeyer. The exact location and orientation of the Mount has been debated for centuries with many other compelling theories&nbsp;suggested.</p>
<p><strong>Straight Joint:</strong>The straight joint is a “seam” where masonry of the Herodian expansion was added to the already existent eastern wall. This seam lends credence to archaeologist Leen Ritmeyer’s theory of a Temple Mount platform of 500 by 500 royal cubits and to his suggestion of the location of the Solomon’s Temple Mount platform as indicated on this&nbsp;map.</p>
<p><strong>Struthion Pool:</strong>The Struthion Pool was a double pool which still lies under the pavement of the Sisters of Zion Convent - the traditional location of Jesus’ judgment before Pilate. Josephus says the pool was open (not covered) during the Roman siege of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. Like other pools in and around the city, this one provided drinking water to city&nbsp;inhabitants.</p>
<p><strong>Susa Gate:</strong>This gate (not mentioned in scripture) provided entry into the Temple Mount area from the northeast. It may be named after the city Susa from which the captives returned. It looks eastward toward the city of Susa and may have been the first place from which the captives surveyed the city upon their return from Babylonian&nbsp;captivity.</p>
<p><strong>Tadi Gate:</strong>Also known as the Sheep Gate, it is mentioned in the reconstruction of Jerusalem in the book of Nehemiah (Neh. 3:1,32; Neh.&nbsp;12:39).</p>
<p><strong>Temple:</strong>Solomon began to build the Temple (the house of the Lord) in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah on the second day of the second month Ziv of the 4th year of his reign (2 Chron. 3:1-2), 480 years after the Exodus from Egypt (1 Kings 6:1). The dimensions of the foundations of the Temple are laid out in detail in the Bible; the length was 60 cubits (a royal cubit was about 20.67 inches) or about 10330*20.67/12= feet; the width was 20 cubits (34 feet); the height was 30 cubits (51.5 feet); the height of the porch was 120 cubits (206.5 feet). More information about its construction materials is found in 1 Kings 6 (1 Kings 6:1-36). It took Solomon seven years to build the house of the Lord (1 Kings 6:38). Solomon received the cedar and cypress for the building of the Temple from King Hiram of Tyre (1 Kings&nbsp;9:11).</p>
<p><strong>Tower:</strong>Raised on the northeastern corner of the Temple Mount, this tower likely afforded a view into the Kidron Valley, and was likely erected for defensive purposes since the north side of the Temple Mount was most vulnerable to attack because of the&nbsp;terrain.</p>
<p><strong>Triple Gate:</strong>The Tripe Gate, built by Herod the Great during the Herodian expansion (19-11 B.C.) led to a tunnel or passageway which extended northward leading to stairs up to the Temple Mount platform. As its name suggests, it was a three gate entrance. The Triple Gate has three doorways - hence its name. The Double and Triple Gate at the southern end of the Temple Mount may be named for Huldah the prophetess (2 Kings 22:8-14). The Double and Triple Gates may have been the location of the original entry into the Temple area during Solomon’s time. Like the Double Gate, this gate provided access to the underground steps which led to the Temple Mount. This gate is now&nbsp;sealed.</p>
<p><strong>Tunnels:</strong>As expansion of the Temple Mount platform continued during the Hasmonean and Herodian periods, tunnels were constructed that allowed entry to the Temple Mount area. The tunnels led to steps that ascended into the Temple Mount area. Located at the south end of the Temple Mount, these tunnels were constructed during the Hasmonean Period (141 B.C.) to allow passage through the Hasmonean addition to the two gates that stood at the southern end of the Temple Mount platform. These tunnels were later known as the Double and Triple Gate&nbsp;passageways.</p>
<p><strong>Tyropoeon Valley:</strong>Located on the western side of the City of David, the Tyropoeon Valley (also known as the Valley of Cheesemakers) was quite deep. Over time the valley has been filled in with debris, making it less precipitous than it was in David’s&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>Warren’s Gate:</strong>This single entrance gate was built during the Herodian expansion (19-11 B.C.) and was at the top of stairs leading to the Temple Mount platform. It was named after its discoverer, Charles Warren, who studied Jerusalem excavations between 1867 and&nbsp;1870.</p>
<p><strong>West Gate:</strong>The West Gate sat atop stairs which extended downward to ground level outside the walls of the Temple Mount. During the Hasmonean period of construction, a bridge would extend westward from the West&nbsp;Gate.</p>
<p><strong>Wilson’s Arch:</strong>Named after the British engineer of the 19th century, Wilson’s arch apparently supported a bridge that ran across the valley to the Upper City. It was likely built during the Herodian period and may have been an addition to the Hasmonean bridge leading westward from the West&nbsp;Gate.</p>
