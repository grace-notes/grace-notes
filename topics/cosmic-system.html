      <h1>Cosmic System</h1>

          <section class="content"><p><strong>by Mark Perkins, Pastor, Front Range Bible Church, Denver, Colorado&nbsp;USA</strong></p>
<p>The term “cosmic system” refers to Satan’s plan and process for controlling the world, and his attempt, using his organization of fallen angels, to counteract the plan of God in all respects. In his plans and programs, Satan will ultimately and certainly fail. Jesus Christ is the victor in the spiritual warfare, the “angelic conflict”. The Lord Jesus sits at the right hand of God the Father in heaven, where all His enemies shall be made his&nbsp;footstool.</p>
<p>The cosmic system has a great impact on the history of a nation. History has certain downward trends which signify the cosmic influence on a nation. For example, Israel at the time of the birth of Christ had been on the downward side of history for quite some time. It is important to take a look at the principles of the cosmic system related to history in order to fully understand the period in&nbsp;question.</p>
<p><strong>General Principles of the Cosmic&nbsp;System</strong></p>
<p>Human history is the resolution of the prehistoric angelic conflict. In order to vindicate himself and His judgment of the fallen angels, God conceived a plan by which sinful human beings could glorify&nbsp;Him.</p>
<p>In order to justify his rejection of the prehistoric grace offer from God, Satan conceived a system designed to counteract the plan of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of the Satan’s cosmic system is as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To keep unbelievers from believing in Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>To destroy the believer’s relationship with&nbsp;God.</p></li>
<li><p>To bring in his own millennium through internationalism and a centralized world&nbsp;government.</p></li>
<li><p>To prevent God’s millennium from&nbsp;arriving.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are three plans in Satan’s cosmic&nbsp;system.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The World&nbsp;Plan</p></li>
<li><p>The Individual&nbsp;Plan</p></li>
<li><p>The Propaganda&nbsp;Plan</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The World Plan of&nbsp;Satan</strong></p>
<p>The world plan is Satan’s plan to bring in His own millennium, and to prevent God from bringing in the Divine Millennium. The world plan is a highly organized international conspiracy of&nbsp;demons.</p>
<p><strong>Eph 6:12</strong>, “<em>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.</em>”</p>
<p>Although the world plan is highly organized through the genius of Satan Himself, the human side is not so. Demons do control human beings through demon possession and demon influence, but the humans themselves are rarely well informed. Often a world conspiracy theory will arise, but these are due to the demonic side and not the human side. There is no Biblical documentation for a human world conspiracy. Humans are simply pawns in Satan’s world&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p><strong>The Individual Plan of&nbsp;Satan</strong></p>
<p>The individual plan is an integral part of the world plan, since human participation in the demonic organization is absolutely essential. The means to the end of the cosmic system is&nbsp;power.</p>
<p>The world branch is constantly grasping for power over the human race and its organizations. Power in the form of human government is of the utmost importance in the world branch of the cosmic system. The more power that the enemy has, the greater he thinks he can be. The more power the enemy has, the more effectively he can carry out his&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p>In every human life and human organization, Satan is grasping for more power, so he can wield it to carry out his plan. Every time that someone or some organization depends on a human viewpoint solution, Satan gains power over their lives. Every time that someone or some organization comes to believe a cosmic counterfeit or lie, Satan gains power over their&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p><strong>The Satanic&nbsp;“Millennium”</strong></p>
<p>As a part of the angelic appeal trial of human history, Satan has developed his idea of a millennium, which is designed to prove his point. In order to bring in his millennium, Satan must have total control of international human authority. This is why there is so much influence towards internationalism in the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>God ordained nationalism after Satan’s first attempt at internationalism at the tower of Babel, Gen.&nbsp;11:19.</p>
<p>Satan will bring in his “millennium”, known as the Period of Great Tribulation, which will only come after the rapture of the church. The Satanic millennium can only be put into place when there are no believers on planet&nbsp;earth.</p>
<p>This ‘millennium’ will be the most chaotic, disastrous, and miserable 7 years in world history. It is the tribulation of the book of&nbsp;revelation.</p>
<p>The intent of the Satanic&nbsp;millennium.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To prove that the prehistoric sentence of God which condemned the fallen angels to eternity in the lake of fire was&nbsp;unfair.</p></li>
<li><p>To prove that Satan is God’s equal, Isa 14:14, “I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most&nbsp;High.”&quot;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The characteristics of the Satanic&nbsp;millennium.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Counterfeit righteousness and injustice under the veil of&nbsp;justice.</p></li>
<li><p>Constant change and lack of&nbsp;dependability</p></li>
<li><p>Treacherous motives and cruel slavery behind the mask of&nbsp;mercy.</p></li>
<li><p>Wrong approaches to problem solving and false solutions which always make the problem&nbsp;worse.</p></li>
<li><p>Chaos and&nbsp;confusion.</p></li>
<li><p>Bad decisions from a position of weakness and a society saturated with&nbsp;evil.</p></li>
<li><p>Dishonesty, obfuscation, evasiveness, and a lack of veracity. (All this sounds like U.S. politics&nbsp;today).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Fight Against the Divine&nbsp;Millennium.</strong></p>
<p>Satan is constantly fighting against the Divine plan for human history. Satan thinks that if he can destroy or delay the Divine millennium, he will somehow gain an advantage in the angelic conflict. He is wrong. He does not have the power to do&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>The Divine Millennium will come at the second advent of Christ, and it therefore immediately follows the tribulation. There have been two attacks in history against the Divine Millennium: the attack against Christ, and the attack against the Jews. These attacks are tantamount to murdering the witnesses of a trial, so that they cannot&nbsp;testify.</p>
<p><strong>The Attacks against&nbsp;Christ.</strong></p>
<p>Jesus Christ will be the world ruler during the Divine Millennium, and His rulership will be&nbsp;fantastic.</p>
<p>There was an attempt to destroy the mediatorship of&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In Genesis 6 there is a record of an attempt to destroy the human genetic purity of the line of&nbsp;Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to be the perfect mediator between God and man, Christ had to be both fully God and fully man in the hypostatic&nbsp;union.</p></li>
<li><p>Satan attempted to destroy the human side of this&nbsp;equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Demons seduced human women and impregnated them. Their children were angelic-human half breeds, and no longer genetically&nbsp;pure.</p></li>
<li><p>Only Noah and his family resisted this demonic conspiracy. This is why the rest of the earth had to be&nbsp;destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>God considered this attack so great, that he imprisoned the angels who participated under the surface of the earth, where they still reside, waiting for their release in the&nbsp;tribulation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There were attempts to kill Christ before He could fulfill the purpose of His&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Satan knew that if he could kill Christ before His time, the plan of God would be stymied. Therefore, there were several attempts on His&nbsp;life.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The attempt of Herod, <strong>Mat 2:13,16</strong>, “_When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream.”Get up,&quot; he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.” “When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the&nbsp;Magi._”</p></li>
<li><p>The attempts of the Pharisees, <strong>Mat 12:14</strong>, “<em>But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.</em>”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>• The attempts of the chief priest and elders, <strong>Mat 26:3,4</strong>, “Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, and they plotted to arrest Jesus in some sly way and kill him.” Of course, all of these attempts failed&nbsp;completely.</p>
<p><em><em>The Attacks against the&nbsp;Jews</em></em></p>
<p>The Jews are God’s chosen people, and they are going to be Christ’s subjects in the Divine Millennium. Therefore, Satan is constantly plotting against the Jews in his attempt to exterminate them as a race of people. There is a tremendous amount of Satanic propaganda against the Jews. The Jewish world conspiracies,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>In every generation, there is an attempt through the Satanic world conspiracy to eliminate the Jews as a race. In the 20th century, there have been at least three attempts at genocide against the&nbsp;Jews.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In Soviet Russia, from 1917 to the&nbsp;present.</p></li>
<li><p>In Nazi Germany, from&nbsp;1933-1945.</p></li>
<li><p>By various Arab nations,&nbsp;today.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>During the tribulation, the genocidal attacks against the Jews will reach their&nbsp;crescendo.</p>
<p>We are to judge the present nation of Israel by the standards of Divine&nbsp;establishment.</p>
<p>We are to judge individual Jews only when they come under our authority or they break the&nbsp;law.</p>
<p>In all other instances, we are to give Jews maximum respect and reservation of&nbsp;judgment.</p>
<p>As a national entity, we are to provide a haven for the Jews, so that they might be free from racial&nbsp;prejudice.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion.</strong></p>
<p>Although these demonically inspired attacks are terrible in their intensity and genius, they have no chance of succeeding. God will protect the Jews until the return of Jesus Christ. He will succeed,&nbsp;easily.</p>
<p>**The Propaganda Plan of&nbsp;Satan*</p>
<p>The purpose of the propaganda plan is to promote the cosmic counterfeits and lies, and to attack the word of God. The propaganda plan integrates and cooperates with both the individual and the world branches of the cosmic system. The propaganda branch is an expression of Satanic genius and the demonic organization. Human beings are an important element in the propaganda&nbsp;branch.</p>
<p><strong>The Promotion of the Cosmic Counterfeits and&nbsp;Lies.</strong></p>
<p>The cosmic system has an elaborate scheme of counterfeits and lies. These counterfeits and lies are designed to supplant the truth. The counterfeits and lies match up with every category of truth possible,&nbsp;including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The&nbsp;Gospel.</p></li>
<li><p>The plan of&nbsp;God.</p></li>
<li><p>The power of&nbsp;God.</p></li>
<li><p>The person and work of God the&nbsp;Father</p></li>
<li><p>The person and work of&nbsp;Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>The person and work of the Holy&nbsp;Spirit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These counterfeits and lies are promoted by every means possible. is a great emphasis today on the media, and especially television. Those who are heavily involved in the cosmic system inevitably become cosmic&nbsp;propagandists.</p>
<p><em><em>The Attack against the Word of&nbsp;God</em></em></p>
<p>In order to make the promotion of the cosmic counterfeits and lies fully effective, the cosmic system attacks the Word. The attacks against the Word come in two basic&nbsp;categories.</p>
<p>Attacks to destroy the Word outright. There have been many attempts throughout history to destroy the manuscripts of the&nbsp;Bible.</p>
<p>Attacks to undermine the credibility of the Word. These are usually attacks on the supernatural nature of the Divine inspiration of the Word. Liberal theologians are mainly responsible for this branch of the attack on the&nbsp;Word.</p>
