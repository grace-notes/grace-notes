      <h1>Test of Knowledge Fundamentals of the Christian Life</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="content">

        <article class="article">
          <section class="content"><p>The following test questions deal with many of the Bible topics which are considered basic to the Christian Way of Life. Doctrines are not called “basic” because they are simple to learn, trivial, or “baby food”, even though they are the most appropriate topics for new Christians to learn. Rather, basic doctrines are those which are fundamental to the Christian Way of Life and spiritual growth and which are prerequisites to the study of advanced concepts of the Bible, just as in mathematics one studies the basic subjects of algebra, trigonometry, and calculus to provide the basis for advanced studies in engineering, physics, medicine, and many other&nbsp;sciences.</p>
<p>Scoring: For each question, decide whether you could give a good answer. Give yourself <strong>one point for each question</strong> you are certain you could explain completely and correctly to another&nbsp;person.</p>
<p>You don’t have to write out answers, although the questions do give a good long-term study outline to&nbsp;follow.</p>
<p><strong>Note: there is no answer key for this “test”. It is provided as a method for self-assessment in your knowledge of Bible&nbsp;truth.</strong></p>
<p>There are documents in the Grace Notes Topics Library which can help you with your studies of these concepts. <a href="http://www.gracenotes.info/"><strong>http://www.gracenotes.info</strong></a></p>
<p>Your score indicates the following ( the numbers are quite arbitrary, of&nbsp;course):</p>
<p><strong>75 to 100</strong> – More than a “passing” grade. Indicates you have a good basic foundation and are ready to study advanced topics. You have probably spent at least 1,000 hours in organized study to reach this level. Your personal witnessing and other exercise of spiritual gifts is well supported by your understanding of God’s Person and Plan. This score would be the minimum expected of anyone going into Christian work as a vocation, such as evangelistic, missionary, or mission support work. This score would also be considered a prerequisite for those entering seminary to prepare for the&nbsp;pastorate.</p>
<p><strong>50 to 74</strong> - Indicates good progress in basics and that you have been serious in your desire to learn God’s Word to this point. Consider increasing the time spent in attending class and studying. Ask your pastor to suggest doctrinal materials or tape studies to supplement classes. You will need another 200 to 400 hours of study to score at the next level, roughly one hour per day for a year, but you can do it more quickly if you put yourself into a crash&nbsp;program.</p>
<p><strong>25 to 49</strong> - Indicates some progress in basics. If you’re over 18, you’re going to have to put yourself into crash program mode to learn the fundamentals - two or more hours per day of directed, organized study, using any doctrinal classes, tapes, materials that you can find. Progress towards Christian maturity requires consistency, hard work, and&nbsp;dedication.</p>
<p><strong>0 to 24</strong> - “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.” While you did not need much knowledge of God or the Bible to be saved, you will need a lot of information from the Word of God about how to think and function as a productive Christian. At least 1,000 hours of work will be required to “pass”, but the eternal significance of the project makes the labor the most rewarding a person can&nbsp;undertake.</p>
