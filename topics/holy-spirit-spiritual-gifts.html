          <section class="content"><p>The Ministry of the Holy Spirit in the Life of the&nbsp;Christian</p>
<p>A <strong>Spiritual Gift</strong> is a unique ability sovereignly given to each believer by the Holy Spirit at the time of salvation for the purpose of serving the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Purpose of this study - to look at all of the Spiritual gifts listed in the New Testament and to understand the purpose and function of each&nbsp;gift.</p></li>
<li><p>Objectives of this study - To show the logic in the use of gifts and to enable each student to be able to understand, for himself, the validity of the permanent gifts and the futility of the temporary gifts in today’s&nbsp;church.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em><em>Introduction to Spiritual&nbsp;Gifts</em></em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>God bestows on every believer at the moment he is saved, at least one Spiritual&nbsp;gift.</p></li>
<li><p>Since each believer is a priest, he is to function in his priesthood as both servants and&nbsp;ambassadors.</p></li>
<li><p>The Believer’s Spiritual gift determines how he is to perform his priestly&nbsp;duties.</p></li>
<li><p>A believer-priest is not on this earth to live for himself, but to live for others. (Love God and love your neighbors as&nbsp;yourself)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ephesians&nbsp;2:10</strong></p>
<p>“<em>For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</em>”</p>
<p>In order for believers to function in their Spiritual gifts, he must first be trained (equipped) by those God has given as teachers and communicators of the Word of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians&nbsp;4:8,11-13</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Therefore it says, ‘WHEN HE ASCENDED ON HIGH, HE LED CAPTIVE A HOST OF CAPTIVES, AND HE GAVE GIFTS TO MEN.’</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>And He gave some as apostles, and some as prophets, and some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers,</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>for the equipping of the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ;</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.</em>”</p>
<p>As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful&nbsp;scheming;</p>
<p>These three benefits of the training our communicators give us are all reflected and accomplished by the function of our Spiritual gifts together for the common&nbsp;good.</p>
<p><em>Spirituality; Introduction to Spiritual&nbsp;Gifts</em></p>
<p>When Studying Spiritual Gifts, it is important to remember the principles of Spirituality that make the function of the Spiritual Gifts possible and&nbsp;effective.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Spirituality is an absolute; you are either spiritual or you’re not. - (Bottom&nbsp;circle)</p></li>
<li><p>Spirituality is what the Spirit of God produces in the life of the believer - we&nbsp;reflect</p></li>
<li><p>A believer is spiritual, not because he’s good or mature, but because the Holy Spirit is in control and leading the believer. - Gal. 5:22-23 Fruit of the&nbsp;Spirit</p></li>
<li><p>Spirituality is accomplished simply by yielding to the Holy Spirit; the will of God and permitting the works of God is our lives. - Walking in the Spirit and being Led by the Spirit. - Gal.&nbsp;5:18;25</p></li>
<li><p>Yielding to the Holy Spirit (being Filled with the Holy Spirit) is accomplished by desire, confession, and dependence on Him. - 1 John (the theme of the&nbsp;epistle)</p></li>
<li><p>Desire (repentance), Confession (acknowledgment of sin), and Dependence (faith) are the three aspects of Spirituality and provide the mechanics to ensure fulfillment of God’s plan for our&nbsp;lives.</p></li>
<li><p>When a believer is Filled with the Holy Spirit, his Spiritual Gift can function within the body (church) of Christ as it was intended to do - Eph.&nbsp;5:18</p></li>
<li><p>Spiritual gifts are given to every believer the moment he believes in Christ - 1 Cor. 12:13; the Christian cannot choose his gift, but merely receives it as one of several benefits occurring at salvation. - (pos.&nbsp;truth)</p></li>
<li><p>It’s important that each believer discover his Spiritual gift, develop his skills in utilizing his gift efficiently, and then put the gift into action as God provides&nbsp;opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p>Spiritual gifts are designed to be used in the local church or in conjunction with the ministries of the local church; Evangelism, missionary work and similar forms of ministries that occur outside the church are designed to help expand and build the church&nbsp;worldwide.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to discover our gifts, we first must know what gifts are given by God and how to recognize&nbsp;them.</p></li>
<li><p>We have three main passages in the New Testament that outline and list the different gifts. Rom 12:3-8, 1 Peter 4:10-11, and 1 Cor. 12:8-10;28-30;&nbsp;14:6,26</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em><em>Christians are the Hands of&nbsp;God</em></em></p>
<p>During the Second World War, a church in Strasbourg was destroyed. After the bombing, the members of this particular church went to see what was left and found that the entire roof had fallen in, leaving a heap of rubble and broken glass. Much to their surprise, however, a statue of Christ with outstretched hands that had been carved centuries before by a great artist was still standing erect. It was virtually unharmed except that both hands had been sheered off by a falling beam. The people hurried to a sculptor in town and asked if he could replace the hands of the statue. He was willing, and he even offered to do it for nothing. The church officials met to consider the sculptor’s proposition - and decided not to accept his offer. Why? Because they felt that the statue without hands would be the greatest illustration possible that God’s work is done through His&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ chooses human hands (gave gifts to men - Eph 4:8-14). Sometimes they seem to be the most infirm hands, the least potentially successful hands, or the least qualified hands – but those are the hands He&nbsp;uses.</p>
<p><strong>Romans&nbsp;12:3-8</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paul wrote the book of Romans to the Christians in the church at&nbsp;Rome</p></li>
<li><p>The theme of the book of Romans is: Justification by faith and the Righteousness of&nbsp;God</p></li>
<li><p>Several basic Christian doctrines are taught in this book: Natural revelation; universality of sin; justification; propitiation; faith; original sin; union with Christ; the election and rejection of Israel; spiritual gifts; and respect for&nbsp;government.</p></li>
<li><p>In chapter 12, Paul discusses the importance of Spiritual Gifts and how these gifts are categorized by God into two permanent&nbsp;categories.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rom 12:3-5,</strong> “<em>For through the grace given to me I say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>For just as we have many members in one body and all the members do not have the same function,</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</em>”</p>
<p>Paul introduces the team concept in the Body of Christ. He shows that each believer shares equally in responsibility and function to one another and to&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>We also see “one family - one father.” We are all children of the same God who is the Father of the one Savior, Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians&nbsp;4:4-6</strong></p>
<p>“<em>There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in one hope of your calling;</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.</em>”</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:6</strong>, “<em>And since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let each exercise them accordingly: if prophecy, according to the proportion of his faith;</em>”</p>
<p>Verse six begins to break down the Spiritual gifts into two&nbsp;categories.</p>
<p>Prophecy - this term in the Greek PROPHETEIAN refers to communications in two&nbsp;forms:</p>
<p>Foretelling the&nbsp;Truth</p>
<p>Forth telling the&nbsp;Truth</p>
<p>To proclaim the Word of God concerning future events and concerning present&nbsp;events.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:7</strong>, “<em>if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;</em>”</p>
<p>Service - DIAKONIA means to wait on tables; it is definitely a serving others&nbsp;concept.</p>
<p>The “one who teaches” is the first of several participles. A participle is used to further define a preceding noun. In this case, teaching clarifies prophecy as being instructive and&nbsp;edifying.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 12:8,</strong>, “<em>or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</em>”</p>
<p>As communicators: teaching &amp; encouraging; As servants: giving, leading and showing&nbsp;mercy</p>
<p>Paul teaches in this passage that doing good in contrast to doing evil, is manifested in the use of our gifts to express our love for one another and to show the love of God to&nbsp;mankind</p>
<p><strong>1 Peter&nbsp;4:10-11</strong></p>
<p>“<em>As each one has received a special gift, employ it in serving one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Whoever speaks, let him speak, as it were, the utterances of God; whoever serves, let him do so as by the strength which God supplies; so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</em>”</p>
<p>The same two categories/types of gifts are given by Peter in this passage: Communication and Serving&nbsp;gifts.</p>
<p>Summary for Romans 12:3-8 and 1 Peter&nbsp;4:10-11</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Your Spiritual Gift should never give rise to feelings of superiority or&nbsp;inferiority.</p></li>
<li><p>Your Spiritual Gift is a Grace Gift - selected by God with our best and the church’s best interests in&nbsp;mind.</p></li>
<li><p>Your S.G. can only function as God empowers (serving gifts) or enlightens (communication&nbsp;gifts).</p></li>
<li><p>Communication gifts are dependent on one’s lever of spiritual understanding (faith comes by&nbsp;hearing)</p></li>
<li><p>Serving gifts require a willingness to serve and the empowering by the Holy Spirit who gives both strength and&nbsp;opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p>The Holy Spirit will give insight to Bible Doctrine and growth to maturity for communicators. He will empower and offer opportunities to serve for non-communication&nbsp;gifts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>N.B.; But, there are actually three types of Spiritual Gifts taught in the New&nbsp;Testament:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Communication&nbsp;Gifts</p></li>
<li><p>Serving&nbsp;Gifts</p></li>
<li><p>Sign&nbsp;Gifts</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians&nbsp;12:4-11</strong></p>
<p>Paul lists several of the spiritual gifts including the third category of spiritual gifts: sign gifts in 1 Corinthians&nbsp;12:4-11</p>
<p>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same&nbsp;Spirit.</p>
<p>And there are varieties of ministries, and the same&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p>And there are varieties of effects, but the same God who works all things in all&nbsp;persons.</p>
<p>But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>Manifestation of the Spirit - this is what Spiritual gifts in action are; evidence of the HS in the life of the believer - gifts = ministries =&nbsp;effects</p>
<p>For the common good - this is the purpose of giving the gifts; to benefit the body not to serve one person or one group of&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Paul begins his list of Spiritual Gifts to the Corinthians in verses&nbsp;8-11.</p>
<p>“<em>For to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, and to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.</em>”</p>
<p>Listed in the Romans and 1 Corinthians passages are the following gifts: Definitions, purpose, function of each gift is given based on examples found both in scripture and in the lives of Christians throughout&nbsp;history.</p>

<p><em><em>Sign&nbsp;Gifts</em></em></p>
<p>A sign gift was a temporary gift given by God to the Christians of the early church in order to fill the void in scripture until scripture was written. - 1 Cor.&nbsp;13:8-10</p>
<p>These were given primarily to the Jews or to testify to the Jews because the Jews sought and demanded signs - 1 Cor. 1:22 cp. Mat. 12:39 (an evil and adulterous generation seeks after a&nbsp;sign).</p>
<p>Sign gifts ceased to function around the time of the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD or at the time of completion of the writing of the NT portion of the Bible - circa. 96&nbsp;AD</p>
<p><em>Healing - 1 Cor.&nbsp;12:9</em></p>
<p>The God given ability to heal a person of various kinds of illness; The purpose in healing was NOT to cure sickness, but to draw attention to the message of the healer and his authority as being sent by&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>Examples of this gift in&nbsp;function:</p>
<p>Acts 3:1-8 - Peter healed a man born a cripple - cp. 4:4 - evangelism&nbsp;resulted</p>
<p>Acts 8:6-7 - Philip healed those paralyzed - cp. 8:12 - salvation resulted among&nbsp;many</p>
<p>Acts 19:12 - Paul healed the sick with handkerchiefs - cp. 19:18-20 = salvation &amp; spiritual motivation among the&nbsp;believers.</p>
<p>Healings - ended a few years after the beginning of the church&nbsp;-</p>
<p>2 Cor. 12:7-10; 1 Tim 5:23; 2 Tim. 4:20; Phil. 2:25-27 - Paul was unable to heal himself or others toward the end of his life. (thorn in the flesh; Timothy’s stomach problems; Trophimus left sick at Miletus; Epaphroditus left sick; Paul was losing his&nbsp;eyesight.</p>
<p>Paul’s last example of healing was in Acts 28:1-10 in an area where the message (the Gospel) was not yet&nbsp;authenticated.</p>
<p><em>Miracles - 1 Cor.&nbsp;12:10</em></p>
<p>The God given ability to cause supernatural events; this gift was never designed to entertain people or to prove the existence of God, but to draw attention to the message of the one performing the miracle. Since the message of the early Christians and Apostles was dramatically different from traditional Judaism, it was necessary to establish authority and credibility before the Jews to authenticate the new message for the church. This gift ended along with the gift of&nbsp;healing.</p>
<p>Examples of this gift in&nbsp;function:</p>
<p>2 Cor. 10:8; Heb. 2:3-4 - Apostles had this&nbsp;gift</p>
<p>Acts 13:8-12 Elymas was struck blind = resulted in salvation of the&nbsp;people</p>
<p>Acts 9:36-43 - Peter raised Dorcas from the dead = many&nbsp;believed</p>
<p>Acts 20:6-12 Paul raised Eutychus from the dead = believers were&nbsp;encouraged</p>
<p>Acts 28:3-6 - Paul was bitten by a poisonous viper. = witnesses refused to&nbsp;believe</p>
<p><em>Prophecy - 1 Cor.&nbsp;13:2</em></p>
<p>Prophecy is a two purpose gift; to foretell the future and to forthtell the present; Similar to the gift of teaching, this communication gift was temporary while the Bible was being written. A person with the gift of prophecy had a supernatural ability to proclaim the Word of God without having the benefit of scripture or previous&nbsp;study.</p>
<p>Examples of this gift in&nbsp;function:</p>
<p>Acts 11:27-28 -&nbsp;Agabus</p>
<p>Acts 13:1 - Barnabas, Symeon, Lucius, Manaen and Saul&nbsp;(Paul)</p>
<p>Acts 21:9 - the four daughters of&nbsp;Philip</p>
<p>1 Cor.14: -Some members of the Corinthian&nbsp;church</p>
<p>Acts 15:32 - Judas and&nbsp;Silas</p>
<p>Prophecy - stopped once the scripture was completely revealed to the Apostles and written (96 AD). - 1 Cor.&nbsp;13:8-10</p>
<p><em>Discerning Spirits - 1 Cor.&nbsp;12:10</em></p>
<p>This is the supernatural ability to discern or distinguish between the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the life of a believer and a demon in the teaching of an unbeliever. Without having the Bible to use to evaluate one’s teaching, the gift of discerning spirits was necessary to assure the early church of accurate teaching from those who claimed to be Prophets or&nbsp;Apostles.</p>
<p>Examples of this gift in&nbsp;function:</p>
<p>1 Tim. 1:20 - Paul was able to discern the motives of the two believers who were blaspheming&nbsp;God</p>
<p>Gal. 2:11-14 - and to discern the motive of Peter when he was hypocritical concerning Law and&nbsp;Grace</p>
<p>Examples of the loss of this Spiritual Gift by the&nbsp;Apostles:</p>
<p>Acts 18:18 - Paul’s inability to keep himself from offering sacrifices and taking the Nazarite vow to God. (A vow that applied only under the Law and not designed for the church - Paul cut his hair breaking the&nbsp;vow).</p>
<p>Acts 15:37-40 cp. 2 Tim. 4:11; Col. 4:10 - Paul disallowed Mark from going on a missionary journey with him because of Mark’s past failures - Paul was not able to discern the true motivation of&nbsp;Mark.</p>
<p>Acts 5:1-11 - Peter was able to discern the true motives of Ananias and Saphira c/w his failure to deal with the Gentiles/Judaizers. (indication he no longer had this&nbsp;gift).</p>
<p>Discerning Spirits was replaced by the completed Bible which gave the ability to discern to ALL believers who know the&nbsp;Word.</p>
<p><em>Tongues - 1 Cor.&nbsp;12:10</em></p>
<p>This is the God given ability to speak a foreign language without prior language training. A person’s education or lack of education made no difference in the function of this gift. In order to evangelize unbelievers of different races, cultures and nations, the sign gift of tongues was given. - 1 Cor.&nbsp;14:22.</p>
<p>Luke 21:20-24 - Warning was given by Jesus to the Jews that their nation and Jerusalem would be destroyed by the&nbsp;Gentiles.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Tongues flourished among the Jews for forty years until the prophecy of Christ was fulfilled and the nation of Israel&nbsp;destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>This warning and eventual destruction was similar to that given by Isaiah to the Northern Kingdom of Israel. - Isaiah&nbsp;28:11</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 Cor. 14:21-22 - This is also the first indication of Tongues in the Bible, quoted by Paul and fulfilled at Pentecost as the final warning to&nbsp;Israel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When the Jews failed to heed this warning as they failed to do under Isaiah, Israel was once again destroyed in 70&nbsp;AD.</p></li>
<li><p>The church (Gentiles) was given an equal share in the inheritance promised to Abraham for the Jews - Eph.&nbsp;3:1-9</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 Cor. 13:8-10 - With the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish nation, Tongues was no longer necessary and thus ceased (stopped) since the warning to Israel was ignored and the prophecy of its destruction was now&nbsp;fulfilled.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This also explains why tongues was only seen three times in the book of Acts and explained in the book of 1 Corinthians all in relation to the Jews. It is not seen or discussed elsewhere in the Word of God or later than 56 AD when 1 Corinthians was&nbsp;written.</p></li>
<li><p>The reason tongues was no longer seen or discussed is primarily because Paul’s writings are addressed to Gentiles and tongues was not an issue or practiced among the Gentiles except as a sign&nbsp;Israel.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the Jews had already been witnessed to by tongues, the Jews living in outlying areas were the only ones who remained to be warned. Paul, the Apostle to the Gentiles, oversaw this with the believers in Corinth who were giving testimony of the pending discipline of Israel and the joint-inheritance with the&nbsp;Gentiles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of this gift in&nbsp;function:</p>
<p>Acts 2; cp. 10:44-46; 19:6 - At Pentecost the church received the gift to communicate the gospel in foreign&nbsp;languages</p>
<p>1 Cor. 12-14) - In Corinth some members of the church spoke languages the rest of the congregation did not&nbsp;understand</p>
<p>cp. Eph 3:1-9 - Tongues (languages) was also a sign to Israel that the Gentiles were now joint heirs in the promises to Abraham - (The Mystery Doctrine of the&nbsp;Church).</p>
<p>1 Cor. 14: 27-40 Biblical regulations for the use of the gift of&nbsp;Tongues:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only two or three believers may speak in tongues as long as at least one person interprets. - vs.&nbsp;27</p></li>
<li><p>No one is allowed to speak in tongues unless there’s an interpreter. - vs.&nbsp;28</p></li>
<li><p>No woman has the gift of tongues since she would not be permitted to speak in church - vs. 34 -&nbsp;35</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking in tongues could not have been forbidden providing it was done according to the above guidelines and as long as it was before the fall of Jerusalem and/or the completion of the canon of scripture - cp. 1 Cor. 13:8-10; - vs.&nbsp;39</p></li>
<li><p>The use of tongues must be done properly and in an orderly manner - vs.&nbsp;40</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Interpretation of Tongues - 1 Cor.&nbsp;12:10</em></p>
<p>This gift accompanied the gift of tongues so those of different languages would understand the message being spoken in the foreign tongue. Tongues was not to be practiced without someone with this gift&nbsp;present.</p>
<p>1 Cor. 13:8-10 - When tongues ceased the gift of Interpretation of Tongues was no longer necessary and thus it ceased as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Examples of this gift in&nbsp;function:</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor.&nbsp;14:26-28</strong></p>
<p>SUMMARY AND&nbsp;APPLICATION</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Knowing what your Spiritual gift is will come with Spiritual&nbsp;growth.</p></li>
<li><p>Functioning in your Spiritual gift does not require that you know what that gift&nbsp;is;</p></li>
<li><p>We need to be led by the Spirit and filled by the Spirit to function properly in our&nbsp;gift.</p></li>
<li><p>Spiritual growth will provide the believer with opportunities to function in their&nbsp;gift.</p></li>
<li><p>Since God has actually created/called us into His family for this purpose, we should not hesitate to desire we be used by God within our gift as soon as possible. - Eph.&nbsp;2:10</p></li>
<li><p>God gives us our Spiritual gift at salvation; therefore praying for a specific gift is unproductive and not&nbsp;necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>God in his omniscience knows where we will and can function bestaccording to His&nbsp;plan.</p></li>
<li><p>No one gift is more important than another; therefore one shouldn’t be looked on as being superior to&nbsp;another.</p></li>
<li><p>Christians are not designed to all have the same gifts, therefore those who would teach that we should all have the gift of tongues or healings or teaching, or something else do not understand 1 Cor. 12-14 and thus are teaching untrue&nbsp;thing.</p></li>
