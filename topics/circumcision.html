          <section class="content"><p>One of the first acts of circumcision in the human race involved&nbsp;Abraham.</p>
<p><em>Genesis&nbsp;17:6-11</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of&nbsp;thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after&nbsp;thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their&nbsp;God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their&nbsp;generations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be&nbsp;circumcised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and&nbsp;you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This initial act of circumcision was the seal of Abraham’s faith in God’s promise of possessing the land. It was the indication that Abraham believed God’s word. Abraham separated himself unto the Lord and to the Lord’s&nbsp;promise.</p>
<p>Circumcision is, therefore, a sign of regeneration for the Jews. It was to the born again Jew what water baptism is to the born-again believer in the Church Age, a&nbsp;sign.</p>
<p>Circumcision is also used by God as a teaching mechanism, a visual aid to provide a picture of regeneration by faith. The circumcision of male children on the 8th day was an act of dedication by the parents. By this means they declared that they would teach salvation by faith to their children. They anticipated that their children would become&nbsp;believers.</p>
<p><em>Col.&nbsp;2:11-13</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of&nbsp;Christ:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the&nbsp;dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all&nbsp;trespasses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Circumcision is also a picture of positional truth, especially the identification with Jesus Christ in His death, burial, and&nbsp;resurrection.</p>
<p>There can be no victory in the Christian way of life without victory over the old life, over the sin nature. This is the application of positional truth to&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>The Lord also used circumcision as a picture of Israel’s restoration to fellowship and&nbsp;service.</p>
<p><strong>READ Joshua&nbsp;5:1-9</strong></p>
<p>This restoration, by faith, was necessary for the victory the Israelites were about to experience (Jericho) and for the time of rest they were about to enter. There can be no victory over Canaan until there is victory over carnality (Egypt). Circumcision denotes separation from the world and the flesh, self-judgment, yieldedness, dedication,&nbsp;commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Romans&nbsp;4:9-13</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for&nbsp;righteousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in&nbsp;uncircumcision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them&nbsp;also.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet&nbsp;uncircumcised.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of&nbsp;faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Circumcision is a sign of imputed righteousness; it is the sign that one has believed and is cleansed by the blood of Christ and has God’s Righteousness credited to his account. Gen. 15:6; 2 Cor.&nbsp;5:21.</p>
<p>The true significance of circumcision was not in the physical act being perpetuated but in the reasons the ritual was begun in the first place. Circumcision was a sign that something had already taken place, namely, Abraham’s&nbsp;salvation.</p>
<p>Circumcision was also a seal. A seal indicates the validity of the thing to which it is attached. It has no significance apart from that which it covers. Circumcision was a seal attached to something valuable,&nbsp;salvation.</p>
<p>During the Church Age, water baptism is the outward sign of an inward faith. Circumcision was the outward sign for the Jews before the Church&nbsp;Age.</p>
<p>Religious Jews tried to make the seal valuable in itself. They attached spiritual value to the act of circumcision, ignoring the substance. They contended that circumcision was needed for salvation, which led to the formation of a ritualistic&nbsp;religion.</p>
<p>Abraham was saved by faith, long before he was circumcised. He is, therefore, the “father of all who believe” because he is the pattern of those who were saved in status quo uncircumcision, whether Jew or&nbsp;Gentile.</p>
