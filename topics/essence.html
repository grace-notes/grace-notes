<p>The phrase &#x201C;Essence of God&#x201D; is a theological term used to refer to God&#x2019;s personal characteristics, or to the facets of His personality. Sometimes the term &#x201C;Attributes of God&#x201D; is used to refer to God&#x2019;s essence. The &#x201C;attributes&#x201D;, or the &#x201C;essence&#x201D;, of God are His primary characteristics, so they cannot be completely communicated to man. They can be described to a degree, but they cannot be fully&nbsp;defined.</p>
<p>Finite man cannot define the infinite. The Bible is the Word of God, and as such it reveals those facts about the Creator that He has seen fit to reveal about&nbsp;Himself.</p>
<p>Man supposes that God thinks like a man. We think God wants revenge, because when we are insulted, we want revenge. When we are cheated, we want immediate justice and retribution. We are indignant and shocked at the behavior of others, so we expect God to be&nbsp;shocked.</p>
<p>But God does not feel insulted. He does not feel cheated. He owns everything. He is not indignant, temperamental, or emotional. He does not throw tantrums (or lightning bolts). He is not surprised or shocked by anything. He is never depressed or&nbsp;moody.</p>
<p>God is not arrogant or egotistical. He knows Himself, is self-assured, and is&nbsp;humble.</p>
<p>God is a rational, logical, stable-minded, patient; and all of His thinking is backed up by His omniscience. He approaches every issue from the basis of His perfect character, the subject of this&nbsp;study.</p>
<p>God approaches every issue regarding human beings out of His love for all men. His thinking toward man takes all of His attributes into consideration, but Love is always present. It is God&#x2019;s thinking about us, in love, that is His perfect grace thinking. He is always gracious, always thinks&nbsp;grace.</p>
<p>Spirituality is one of God&#x2019;s primary attributes. God is immaterial, in a universe that is made up of both material and&nbsp;immaterial.</p>
<p>God has revealed something of what He is in the Word, but only He knows Himself fully. We must rely on what is written in the Bible for any understanding of what God is&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>The fact that God is a spiritual being means that He lives. Spirituality implies life. Jer. 10:10 and 1 Th. 1:9 tell us that God is alive and well. The life of God has no beginning and no ending. God is&nbsp;eternal.</p>
<p>The Christian shares God&#x2019;s eternal life, but since his eternal life has a beginning at the time he accepted Jesus Christ as Savior, his eternal life is properly called &#x201C;everlasting&nbsp;life&#x201D;.</p>
<p>All of the characteristics of the divine essence are present in God at all times, but not all are manifest at the same time, just as while all colors are present in a ray of white light, the individual colors can be seen only under certain conditions of reflection or refraction. Various attributes of God can be seen in certain situations. For&nbsp;example:</p>
<p>&#x2022; In salvation, God&#x2019;s love and eternal life are&nbsp;apparent.</p>
<p>&#x2022; In judgment, His righteousness and justice are&nbsp;manifested.</p>
<p>&#x2022; In God&#x2019;s faithfulness, His immutability and veracity are&nbsp;shown.</p>
<p>&#x2022; In God&#x2019;s Plan, His omniscience and sovereignty are&nbsp;seen.</p>
<p>&#x2022; In God&#x2019;s will, sovereignty is&nbsp;paramount.</p>
<p>&#x2022; In God&#x2019;s revelation, veracity, love, and omniscience are&nbsp;obvious.</p>
<p>The rest of this paper is devoted to a description of the ten characteristics of the Essence of God as seen in the various Bible passages that describe&nbsp;them.</p>

<p><strong>Deut. 4:39.</strong>Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the Lord, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no&nbsp;other.</p>
<p><strong>I Sam. 2:6-8.</strong> The Lord kills and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>The Lord makes poor and rich; He brings low, He also&nbsp;exalts.</p>
<p>He raises the poor from the dust, He lifts the needy from the ash heap To make them sit with nobles, And inherit a seat of honor; For the pillars of the earth are the Lord&#x2019;s, And He set the world on&nbsp;them.</p>
<p><strong>1 Chron. 29:11.</strong>Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, indeed everything that is in the heavens and the earth; Yours is the dominion, O Lord, and You exalt Yourself as head over&nbsp;all.</p>
<p><strong>2 Chron. 20:6.</strong>and he said, &#x201C;O Lord, the God of our fathers, are You not God in the heavens? And are You not ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations? Power and might are in Your hand so that no one can stand against&nbsp;You.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 83:18.</strong>That they may know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, Are the Most High over all the&nbsp;earth.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 45:5,6.</strong>I am the Lord, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God. I will gird you, though you have not known&nbsp;Me;</p>
<p>That men may know from the rising to the setting of the sun That there is no one besides&nbsp;Me.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 17:24,25.</strong> The God who made the world and all things in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with&nbsp;hands;</p>
<p>nor is He served by human hands, as though He needed anything, since He Himself gives to all people life and breath and all&nbsp;things</p>
</section>
<section id="god-has-a-will." class="level2">
<h2><a href="/topics/essence.html#god-has-a-will.">God has a&nbsp;will.</a></h2>
<p>God is eternal, infinite, and self-determining. He makes decisions, policies and sets up principles. This is divine&nbsp;volition.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel 4:35.</strong>All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, But He does according to His will in the host of heaven And <em>among</em>the inhabitants of earth; And no one can ward off His hand Or say to Him, &#x2018;What have You&nbsp;done?&#x2019;</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 6:13,14.</strong> For when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by&nbsp;Himself,</p>
<p>Saying, I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply&nbsp;you.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 47:7.</strong>For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with&nbsp;understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 115:3.</strong>But our God is in the heavens; He has done whatsoever he&nbsp;pleased.</p>
<p>In His sovereignty, God decided to give man a free will. The meeting place of man&#x2019;s will and God&#x2019;s will is the cross. (John&nbsp;3:16)</p>
<p>God&#x2019;s sovereign plan for the human race is first, salvation, &#x201C;Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ&#x201D; (Acts 16:31); second, during life on earth as a believer, to be filled with the Holy Spirit and to grow in Christ (Eph 5:18; I Peter 3:18); and third, to have eternal life in heaven, in a resurrection&nbsp;body.</p>

<p><strong>Rev.&#xA0;19:2</strong></p>
<p>In the application of the concept of God&#x2019;s righteousness to the unbeliever, it is important to remember that His righteousness is absolute. This means that He cannot fellowship with sin. He must demand the same perfection of His creatures. Man&#x2019;s concept of righteousness is relative (Isa. 64:6); but no one can measure up to the divine standard nor achieve absolute righteousness by self effort. However, the righteousness of God is freely available to all who&nbsp;believe.</p>

<p><strong>Rom.&nbsp;3:22-23.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tit.&nbsp;3:5.</strong></p>
<p><strong>JUSTICE</strong></p>
<p>God is just and cannot be unfair. His justice demands that disobedience against His laws be punished. Justice administers the penalty that righteousness&nbsp;demands.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 19:9.</strong>the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous&nbsp;altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 50:6. &#x2026;</strong>for God is judge&nbsp;Himself.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 58:11. &#x2026;</strong>verily he is a God that judges in the&nbsp;earth.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus Christ, through His substitutionary, effective death on the cross, transferred the guilt of the sinner onto Himself, thus satisfying the justice of God. God is now free to pardon the sinner and justify the one who accepts His saving grace. God is equally free to justly condemn all who reject salvation.

<p><strong>Jer. 31:3.</strong>The Lord has appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved you with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>God, in His sovereignty, decided to treat man in grace. It is His love that motivates His grace. Righteousness and justice stood in the way because of the sin barrier between man and God. In love, God the Father sent His Son to the cross to die for the sins of the whole world. Righteousness and justice are thus satisfied, the barrier is removed, and love and grace can be given to&nbsp;men.</p>

<p><strong>The&nbsp;Trinity</strong></p>
<p>There are three distinct persons of the Godhead, each possessing the entire essence of deity. The three persons comprise what the Scripture represents as the ONE TRUE GOD. In the unity of the Godhead (Acts 17:29; Rom. 1:20 and Col. 2:9) there are three persons on one substance, power and eternity (Isa. 48:16; Luke 3:22; John 14:16; Rom. 15:30; 1 Cor. 12:4-6 and 1 John&nbsp;4:13,14)</p>
<p>The full title of God is &#x201C;God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit&#x201D;. (Matt. 28:19 and 2 Cor. 13:14). Each person is made up of the same divine characteristics, making each equal to either of the other two (John 10:30and 16:15) Therefore, when the Bible speaks of God as being One, it is a reference to essence; when speaking of the members of the Godhead, it is a reference to the&nbsp;persons.</p>
