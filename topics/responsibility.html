<p>Matthew&nbsp;5:13-16</p>
<p>Translation: &#x201C;13 You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt becomes foolish, how will it be salty? It is useful for nothing further except when cast outside to be trampled by men. 14 You are the light of the world. A city is not able to hide while laying on a hill; 15 nor do they light a lamp and put it under the peck-measure, but they put it on the lampstand, and it illuminates all that is in the house. 16 So let your light shine before men, so that they might behold your good works and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.&#x201D; 2.&nbsp;Outline.</p>
<p>The principle of salt,&nbsp;v.13.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The identification of the hearers with&nbsp;salt.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The application of salt to&nbsp;witnessing.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The loss of saltiness due to&nbsp;foolishness.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The uselessness of saltless&nbsp;salt.</p>
<p>The principle of light,&nbsp;vv.14-16.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The identification of the hearers with light,&nbsp;v.14a.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The unhideability principle,&nbsp;v.14b.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The foolishness of lighting and hiding,&nbsp;v.15a.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The usefulness of the fully exposed light,&nbsp;v.15b.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The application to the hearers,&nbsp;v.16.</p>
<p>This passage is not all what you might think, for it poses a dispensational variable exclusive to the dispensation of the hypostatic&nbsp;union.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot of application into the church age believer&#x2019;s life, you should know from the top that the church age believer has&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>Distinctions.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The Dispensation of Israel concentrated on corporate witnessing. The nation itself was the prime element of light to the world. There are only a couple of notable exceptions like&nbsp;Jonah.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The Dispensation of the Hypostatic Union required individual participation in the internal mission of witnessing to unbelieving Israel. But the followers of Christ also had an ambassadorial function to the whole world of&nbsp;unbelievers.</p>
<p>&#xB7; The Dispensation of the Church requires individual participation in the external mission of witnessing to the unbelieving world. Since this is an external mission, the Bible calls the church age believer an ambassador, 2 Corinthians&nbsp;5:20.</p>
<p>During the church age, any organization or nation built on strong establishment principles and with a strong missionary movement will have an excellent corporate witness without even&nbsp;trying.</p>
<p>However, the responsibility of personal evangelism lies heavily on the individual, and functions entirely apart from the corporate&nbsp;witness.</p>
<p>Therefore the techniques of personal evangelism set forth in this passage apply equally to church age&nbsp;believers.</p>
<p>This was a difficult time for personal&nbsp;evangelism.</p>
<p>Evangelism of the Jews was very difficult because of the stranglehold of the legalistic&nbsp;Pharisees.</p>
<p>Evangelism of the Gentiles was very difficult because of the national pride of Rome and the insidious idolatry of the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>It is important to observe that Christ does not introduce the subject of personal evangelism until after He has fully covered the plan of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>Witnessing has its proper place as the natural outgrowth of the fulfillment of the plan of God, and the believer&#x2019;s love for&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>Witnessing becomes more effective because of spiritual&nbsp;growth.</p>
<p>Witnessing can be a roundabout motivation for spiritual&nbsp;growth.</p>
<p>The principle of salt,&nbsp;v.13.</p>
<p>Christ first identifies His hearers with salt. &#x201C;You are the salt of the earth.&#x201D; Remember that His hearers are the inner circle of His disciples, and therefore this comparison is restricted to members of the kingdom of God&nbsp;alone.</p>
<p>They are identified with salt, and also their comparison with it is extended to the&nbsp;earth.</p>
<p>The word GEN translates &#x2018;earth&#x2019;. Although it may denote &#x2018;Israel&#x2019; at times, it does not in this context. The other times that Christ employs GEN in this sermon, it is always in the sense of the entire&nbsp;planet.</p>
<p>They are the salt which belongs to the whole earth, and more specifically the people on&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Now salt has some natural connotations, and some Biblical connotations. We will combine the two before we go on with the&nbsp;passage.</p>
<p>Salt had three useful purposes in the ancient near&nbsp;east.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It preserved food. Since they lived before the age of refrigeration, and far from any usable ice, they had to preserve their foods by other means. Salt was the answer to this&nbsp;need.</p></li>
<li><p>It seasoned food. Salt adds a great deal of seasoning to almost any food. Even many dessert recipes contain significant amount of&nbsp;salt.</p></li>
<li><p>It served as a fertilizer. Many fertilizers contain salt as a major&nbsp;ingredient.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Salt was a part of the ritual plan for&nbsp;Israel:</p>
<p>Leviticus 2:13, &#x201C;Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God shall not be lacking from your grain offering; with all your offerings you shall offer&nbsp;salt.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Numbers 18:19 provides the interpretation for the inclusion of salt in the Levitical offerings, &#x201C;All the offerings of the holy gifts, which the sons of Israel offer to the Lord, I have given to you and your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual allotment. It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord to you and your descendants with&nbsp;you.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Obviously, the preservative power of salt is emphasized in this&nbsp;covenant.</p>
<p>Salt therefore represents the faithfulness and integrity of God in standing behind His covenants with&nbsp;Israel.</p>
<p>2 Chronicles 13:5 confirms this very thing, &#x201C;Do you not know that the Lord God of Israel gave the rule over Israel forever to David and his sons by a covenant of&nbsp;salt?&#x201D;</p>
<p>Christ uses the term twice in Mark 9:49-50, &#x201C;For everyone will be salted with fire. Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalted, with what will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one&nbsp;another.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Salted with fire is a reference to salt as a seasoning. Salted with fire refers to undeserved suffering for blessing. Undeserved suffering seasons the believer - i.e., makes him&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>The second use is a reference to doctrine as a seasoning in the heart of the believer. Only doctrine can cause unity among&nbsp;Christians.</p>
<p>Paul also uses it in Colossians 4:6 as a symbol for seasoning, &#x201C;Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned, as it were, with salt, so that you may know how you should respond to each&nbsp;person.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Salt represents the tailoring of the words of the personal evangelist, so that each time the gospel is given it is&nbsp;unique.</p>
<p>This method is far superior to the dissemination of gospel tracts, because the message is personalized, and accounts for whatever the individual may need to hear as a part of the&nbsp;presentation.</p>
<p>Now when Christ told His hearers that they were the salt of the earth, He meant that they were the seasoning for it. Their spreading of the Gospel would bring good to their country, and to the whole&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Now Christ continues: &#x201C;but if the salt becomes foolish, how will it be salty? It is useful for nothing further except when cast outside to be trampled by&nbsp;men.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s right. Christ said foolish. This is the only reference in all of ancient Greek literature up to that time where the verb MORAINO describes a loss of&nbsp;flavor.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is a reason. Christ wanted to make a connection between cosmic involvement for the believer and his loss of seasoning&nbsp;power.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore Christ depicts the loss of seasoning power with the verb which means&nbsp;&#x2018;foolish&#x2019;.</p></li>
<li><p>Your involvement in the cosmic system destroys your effectiveness in personal&nbsp;evangelism.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The translation is very precise on that point: &#x201C;if the believer becomes foolish, how will he be effective in personal&nbsp;evangelism?&#x201D;</p>
<p>It is noteworthy to point out that the word &#x2018;again&#x2019; does not appear in the original Greek. Although it is often included in English translations, it skews the meaning of the&nbsp;passage.</p>
<p>Christ is saying precisely this: that your residence in the cosmic system temporarily destroys your Christian witness. You do not have the ability to recall doctrine for the purpose of&nbsp;evangelization.</p>
<p>Christ is not saying anything at all about recovery from the cosmic system, or the lasting effects of cosmic involvement on personal&nbsp;evangelism.</p>
<p>Note this: when you recover from sin through confession, your ability to give the gospel is completely&nbsp;restored.</p>
<p>If you have gone a long time in the cosmic system, your arsenal of doctrines may be well depleted or quite stale, and that also lends itself to weakness; but! God the Holy Spirit is the power factor in evangelism through His common grace ministry, and therefore there is no lack of power in your&nbsp;evangelization.</p>
<p>You are therefore useless to God in the realm of personal evangelism when you are out of&nbsp;fellowship.</p>
<p>E. The principle of light,&nbsp;vv.14-16.</p>
<p>Christ begins this passage in the same way as He did the preceding: He identifies His hearers with the inanimate object of His&nbsp;illustration.</p>
<p>So, His listeners are light. The direct association of the two technically makes this a&nbsp;metaphor.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are the light of the world. He employs the noun KOSMOU as a synonym for GES. This noun still depicts the entire world, and is definitely not restricted to just&nbsp;Israel.</p>
<p>There is one significant reference to light in the Mosaic Law: it is the golden&nbsp;lampstand.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Materials: It was made of pure&nbsp;gold.</p></li>
<li><p>Description.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>It was on the South side of the Holy&nbsp;place.</p></li>
<li><p>It was identical to the modern menora. It had a main shaft which had on each side three projecting&nbsp;branches.</p></li>
<li><p>It had a system of oil-holding cups, which were under each of the lamps. These cups were shaped like almond blossoms and&nbsp;buds.</p></li>
<li><p>Even the wick trimmers and trays were made of pure&nbsp;gold.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Use.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>The lampstand was used to light the Holy&nbsp;place.</p></li>
<li><p>The incense altar, and the table of showbread were lit by this&nbsp;lampstand.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Symbology.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Note that this is made of pure gold only. It represented God the Holy Spirit. There was no wood, and therefore, no&nbsp;humanity.</p></li>
<li><p>God the Holy Spirit provides the light for our daily lives. With light, we have true understanding. Human beings depend very much on sight for understanding. Light is very necessary for&nbsp;sight.</p></li>
<li><p>The light is shed on the table of shewbread, and thus the Spirit provides light for understanding the&nbsp;Word.</p></li>
<li><p>The light is shed on the incense altar, and thus the Spirit provides light for the production of righteousness through the&nbsp;Word.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that the Spirit provides light for the life and ministry of Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Next, Christ relates the unhideability principle. A city is unable to hide while laying on a hill. The picture comes to mind of the modern city with all of its lights lit up at night. As long as that city is on the hill it cannot be hidden in any&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>This relates to the personal witness of the believer in Jesus Christ. You are on the hill when you are in fellowship and under the ministry of God the Holy&nbsp;Spirit.</p>
<p>The city on the hill is fellowship, because this metaphor contrasts the preceding one with regard to content. Since the preceding one is about being out of fellowship, and talks about the weakness of the witness of the one out of fellowship, so this one must be referring to fellowship, and the strength of the witness of the one in&nbsp;fellowship.</p>
<p>There is also a second illustration with light at its core. The lamp is a metaphor for the ministry of the Spirit related to personal&nbsp;evangelism.</p>
<p>Lighting a light is analogous to the moment of salvation for the believer. It is at that moment that the believer receives the ministry of the Spirit. The lamp is re-lit each time the believer confesses his&nbsp;sins.</p>
<p>It is quite foolish to light a lamp and then put it under a cover. To do so would not only eliminate its true effectiveness, but would shortly extinguish the lamp through&nbsp;suffocation.</p>
<p>However, if you put a lamp on a lampstand, you make it effective enough to light everything that is in the&nbsp;house.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the believer who is under the ministry of the Spirit through&nbsp;fellowship.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Again, your personal witness is nothing without the ministry of the Spirit, and you must be in fellowship to tap&nbsp;that.</p></li>
<li><p>Without the ministry of the Spirit you are completely helpless to use the doctrines in your soul in the course of a personal evangelism&nbsp;encounter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#x201C;all that is in the house&#x201D; Is not a reference to people; this is a dative plural adjective and definite article combination - PASIN TOIS. It is instead a reference to things, and so it connects with the doctrine in the soul of the&nbsp;believer.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The lamp is the Holy Spirit; you light it by maintaining and re-establishing&nbsp;fellowship.</p></li>
<li><p>The Holy Spirit gives light to all that is in the house of your soul. He uses everything that is there in a witnessing&nbsp;encounter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The final statement that Christ makes on the subject is in verse 16: &#x201C;So let your light shine before men, so that they might behold your good works and glorify your Father Who is in&nbsp;heaven.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A very important part of this translation is the meaning of&nbsp;HOUTO.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It denotes that Christ is about to apply his illustration to His&nbsp;listeners.</p></li>
<li><p>It takes the metaphor of the preceding verses and makes it&nbsp;real.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>&#x201C;your light&#x201D; is of course the ministry of God the Holy Spirit specifically related to your &#x2018;good&nbsp;works&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Christ employs the imperative of entreaty to politely communicate a command. In other words, this is not really an option in the Christian&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>The ministry of the Spirit in your soul is to shine before men. This means that you do not stifle that ministry by getting out and staying out of&nbsp;fellowship.</p>
<p>If you remain in fellowship, the ministry of the Spirit is going to shine; and good works are going to&nbsp;result.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>KALA ERGA is translated &#x2018;good works&#x2019;. KALA is really a weaker word for good. AGATHOS is the usual word for good manufactured from&nbsp;spirituality.</p></li>
<li><p>However, it is the right word for describing outward beauty, so it is appropriate&nbsp;here.</p></li>
<li><p>Works of outward beauty or good can be many: anything that you do under the power of the Spirit can be a part of this&nbsp;classification.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Works of Christian service, including the function of your spiritual gift; charity; service related to&nbsp;citizenship.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything you do that imitates the character of&nbsp;God.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The point is that these works of outward good are visible before&nbsp;men.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>This is not something that you must try to do! This is simply what happens when you are under the doctrinal guidance of God the Holy&nbsp;Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p>You must not be shy when given the opportunity to let your light shine. To do so is to reject the authority of God the Holy Spirit, and that means&nbsp;sin.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Lighting your light and displaying it for all to see has a purpose: it is so that men might glorify your Father Who is in&nbsp;heaven.</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>Men glorify God by believing in Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p></li>
<li><p>Men glorify God by fulfilling His&nbsp;plan.</p></li>
