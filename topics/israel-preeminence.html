      <h1>The Pre-Eminence of Israel</h1>

          <section class="content"><p>The nation of Israel had an extraordinary beginning, one of the most unusual of any race in history. The origin of Israel beginning with Abraham’s departure from Ur in Chaldea, the deliverance of Israel from Egypt in Moses time, and many other striking events, give the Jewish race a unique place in the history of&nbsp;mankind.</p>
<p>The Jews are not only unique as a race, but they are also a branch of the Semitic races, the descendants of Shem. Semitics include Arabs, Syrians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, along with such tribes names in the OT as the Moabites, Edomites, and the Midianites. Abraham was a Chaldean, having been born and raised in Ur of&nbsp;Chaldea.</p>
<p>But it is the Jews who were the chosen nation, the people selected to live under a Theocracy, with all the privileges and responsibilities of that position. It is well to be warned against any form of anti-Semitism. During the present Church Age, the Jews are under divine judgment, and God does not permit any interference with His judgment. Matt. 7:1&nbsp;ff.</p>
<p>The doctrine of Israel’s preëminence is first declared in the Abrahamic Covenant. Gen. 12:1-3; 13:15,16; 22:15-18; 26:3,4; Ex. 6:2-8. This covenant is a reminder to us that long before our European ancestors were painting themselves blue and green and worshipping rocks and trees, God had taken a special man, Abraham, and created a special race of people, by Grace, which had a flourishing intellectual society more than 1,000 years before the time of&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>Israel neither earned nor deserved this special attention. The Lord did not choose them because of any merit on their part, or on Abraham’s part. But the Abrahamic covenant guarantees the Jews two things: 1) the Jews will live throughout history in spite of every Satanic attempt to destroy them through anti-Semitism; and 2) the born-again Jews from Abraham to the second coming of Christ will have a place forever that is unique and fantastic in God’s plan. The preëminence of Israel is based on several important&nbsp;factors.</p>
<p>First, the preëminence of Israel is based upon their custodianship of divine communication of revelation in written form. The Jews were recipients of direct divine revelation from God; and they eventually because custodians of the Canon of Scripture. Rom. 3:2. The presence of doctrine and the teaching ministry of the Jews also provides a basis for the preëminence of Israel. The nations Preëminence stems also from their responsibility for writing the Scriptures and communicating them to the world. The writers of the Old Testament were all Jews who had the gift or office of prophet. In addition, all of the New Testament writers except Luke were&nbsp;Jews.</p>
<p>The preëminence of Israel is also based on the uniqueness of the Mosaic Law the significance of the attending ritual of&nbsp;circumcision.</p>
<p>Israel is distinct because they have a land which belongs to them forever. No one else has been promised a piece of real estate by God. The Palestinian Covenant is detailed in Gen. 15:18; Num. 34:1-12; Deut. 30:1-9; Josh. 1:3,4. This land goes from the Nile River to the Euphrates and from the Mediterranean Sea to the Gulf of Akabah. The preëminence of Israel is also based on having a King who will reign forever, Jesus Christ of the line of David. 2 Sam. 7:8-16; Ps.&nbsp;89:20-37.</p>
<p>The preëminence of Israel is based on the fact that, even though they have been disciplined and scattered, they will be regathered and restored at the Second Advent of Christ. Isa. 5:26-30; 10:19-23; 11:11-16; 14:1-3; 60:4-6; Joel 2:16 ff; Zech. 10:6-12. Therefore, the Jews’ preëminence is related to their survival in spite of anti-Semitism. Rev. 12; Zech.&nbsp;14:16-21.</p>
<p>Finally, the preëminence of Israel is based on the pattern of Abraham’s salvation. Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:1-16,22,23. Born again Jews of all time will participate in these&nbsp;promises.</p>
