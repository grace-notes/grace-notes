<p>This article is a description of the writings which evangelical Christians have ruled are <em>not canonical</em>, that is, they don&#x2019;t belong in the inspired&nbsp;Bible.</p>
<p>The word <strong>canon</strong> refers to any standard or convention, and the word is widely used in a variety of applications. The word comes from the Greek <strong>kanon</strong>meaning &#x201C;rule&#x201D; or &#x201C;measuring stick&#x201D;. For example, a <strong>musical canon</strong> follows a certain pattern, such as using a melody with one or more imitations (cf.&#xA0;Pachelbel&#x2019;s Canon). The <strong>Canon of Dutch Literature</strong> is a listing of the most important Dutch literary works, based on a standard adopted for what books belong in the&nbsp;list.</p>
<p>A <strong>biblical canon</strong> or <strong>canon of scripture</strong> is a list of books considered to be authoritative scripture by a particular religious community. And there is a huge variety of canonical lists, which have been developed from ancient times down to the present, such&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The Jewish&nbsp;Canon</p></li>
<li><p>Samaritan&nbsp;Canon</p></li>
<li><p>Latter Day Saints&nbsp;Canon</p></li>
<li><p>Endless varieties of Christian&nbsp;Canons</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><a href="/topics/apocrypha.html#christian-canons">Christian&nbsp;Canons</a></h2>
<p>The early church used the Old Testament Canon which was adopted by the Septuagint&nbsp;translators.</p>
<p>Writings attributed to the apostles circulated amongst the earliest Christian communities. The Pauline epistles were circulating in collected forms by the end of the 1st century AD. Justin Martyr, in the early 2nd century, mentions the &#x201C;memoirs of the Apostles,&#x201D; which Christians called &#x201C;gospels,&#x201D; and which were considered to be authoritatively equal to the Old&nbsp;Testament.</p>
<p>Gradually, as New Testament writings began to be assembled and examined, a very large variety of &#x201C;rules&#x201D; were adopted, by many different divisions of Christianity, aimed at deciding on which writings were authoritative. And so we&nbsp;have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marcion&#x2019;s canon, thought to have been the first attempt at a Christian&nbsp;canon.</p></li>
<li><p>The various canons of the Apostolic&nbsp;Fathers</p></li>
<li><p>Various canons developed by synods and committees of Christian bishops and&nbsp;elders.</p></li>
<li><p>The canon of the Eastern Orthodox Church (Alexandrian&nbsp;fathers)</p></li>
<li><p>The canon(s) of the Roman Catholic&nbsp;church</p></li>
<li><p>Luther&#x2019;s&nbsp;Canon</p></li>
<li><p>The Protestant&nbsp;Canon</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="/topics/apocrypha.html#our-canon">&#x201C;Our&#x201D;&nbsp;Canon</a></h3>
<p>In evangelical Christianity, the term <strong>canon of scripture</strong> refers to those Christian writings which are judged to have been inspired by God. That is to say, these books have been subjected to examination to determine that they are <strong>inspired</strong> literature, thus having ultimate authority. Here is the definition of <strong>inspiration</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>: God the Holy Spirit so supernaturally directed the human writers of Scripture, that without waiving their human intelligence, individuality, literary style, personal feelings or any other human factor, His own complete and coherent message to man was recorded in perfect accuracy in the original languages of Scripture, the very words bearing the authority of divine&nbsp;authorship.</p>
<p>The task of determining that some writings are inspired, and the rules (canons) to be applied, is the subject of Bible seminary courses on Biblical Introduction. You can imagine that there is much controversy, doubt, and discussion about whether it is even possible to make such a determination, let alone how to go about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Christian Bible teaching is based on the acceptance of the present organization of the Old Testament and New Testament canons, as found in the Protestant Bibles (King James, New American Standard,&nbsp;etc.).</p>

<h2><a href="/topics/apocrypha.html#the-apocrypha">The&nbsp;Apocrypha</a></h2>
<p>The word <strong>Apocrypha</strong> means &#x201C;hidden,&#x201D; or &#x201C;secret.&#x201D; The term &#x201C;Apocrypha&#x201D; is usually applied to a collection of books, from eleven to sixteen in number, which appeared during the interim between the Old and New Testaments. These books have come down to us in more or less close connection with the canonical books of the&nbsp;Bible.</p>
<p>These books have a strange history. Ecclesiastical opinion in different periods has differed widely as to the value of this literature, and as to whether any of these books are divinely inspired. The Jews of the Dispersion in Egypt placed a high estimate upon these books and included them in the Greek translation of the Old Testament, called the Septuagint; but there were rejected from the Hebrew canon by the Jews of&nbsp;Palestine.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church, in the Council of Trent, 1546 AD, declared eleven of the books to be canonical, and they appear in the modern Catholic editions of the&nbsp;Scriptures.</p>

<h2><a href="/topics/apocrypha.html#the-view-of-the-protestant-church">The View of the Protestant&nbsp;Church</a></h2>
<p>It is commonly agreed that some of these books contain material of literary merit and historical value. But the canonicity of all of the books of the Apocrypha has been rejected, and they have been gradually omitted from the modern editions of the Protestant Bibles, for the following&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>They are never quoted by Jesus, and it is doubtful if they were ever alluded to by the&nbsp;apostles.</p></li>
<li><p>Most of the early Church Fathers regarded them as non&nbsp;inspired.</p></li>
<li><p>The books did not appear in the Ancient Hebrew&nbsp;canon.</p></li>
<li><p>The inferior quality of most of the writings, as compared with the canonical books, stamps them as unworthy of a place in the sacred&nbsp;Scriptures.</p></li>

<p>During the early Christianity centuries, most Greek and Latin church fathers, such as Iranaeus, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, and Cyprian, none of whom knew the Hebrew language, quoted passages from the Apocryphal books as &#x201C;scripture&#x201D;, &#x201C;divine scripture&#x201D;, and&nbsp;&#x201C;inspired&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Only occasionally did a Father make an effort to learn the limits of the Hebrew Old Testament&nbsp;canon.</p>
<p>In the 4<sup>th</sup> Century many Greek fathers came to recognize the difference between the books in the Hebrew canon and the rest of the books which some held to be scripture (Eusebius, Athanasius, Cyril of Jerusalem, Gregory of Nazianzus, Amphilochious,&nbsp;Epiphanius).</p>
<p>The Latin (Roman) church, at the council of Hippo (393 AD), and the council of Carthage (419 AD), authorized the use of apocryphal books as&nbsp;scripture.</p>
<p>In the 14<sup>th</sup> century, John Wycliffe produced the first English version of the Bible. This included all the Apocrypha except II Esdras. However, he stated that these books were not authoritative for&nbsp;doctrine.</p>
<p>The first edition of the Swiss-German Bible, or the church of Zurich, 1527-1529, is written in six volumes, the fifth volume being the Apocrypha. They were described as &#x201C;books which are not reckoned as Biblical by the ancients nor found among the&nbsp;Hebrews.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Council of Trent, in 1546, from the viewpoint of the Roman Catholic church, gave the first &#x201C;infallible&#x201D; approval of the Apocrypha. The Council also pronounced a decree of anathema on any who refused to acknowledge these writings as canonical (inspired). The list did not include, however, the Prayer of Manasses or the books of I and II&nbsp;Esdras</p>
<p>At the synod of Jerusalem in 1672, the books of Wisdom, Judith, Tobit, Bel and the Dragon, Susanna, Maccabees, and Ecclesiasticus were designated as&nbsp;canonical.</p>
<p>In England, the Protestants were united in rejecting the Apocryphal books as canonical, but there were various differences as to how the books could be used. Some thought they would be valuable as sermons, others are resources for&nbsp;research.</p>
<p>The Puritans published a Bible that did not contain the Apocrypha, their having an aversion to any human book that was not in the Hebrew or Greek&nbsp;canon.</p>
<p>The earliest version of the English Bible which excluded the Apocrypha were some Geneva Bibles printed in 1599 in&nbsp;Belgium.</p>
<p>George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and one of the translators of the King James Bible, in 1615 gave public notice that no copy of the Bible was to be bound or sold which<em>did not</em> contain the Apocrypha. However, there was a growing demand for non-Apocrypha Bibles, and copies began showing up without it in the years from 1616 to&nbsp;1633.</p>

<h3><a href="/topics/apocrypha.html#reasons-for-rejecting-the-old-testament-apocrypha">Reasons for Rejecting the Old Testament&nbsp;Apocrypha</a></h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is universally admitted that the Old Testament apocryphal books never had a place in the Hebrew&nbsp;canon.</p></li>
<li><p>They were never quoted in the New Testament, either by Christ or His&nbsp;apostles.</p></li>
<li><p>Josephus excludes them, he limits the number of books to 22, which he&nbsp;lists.</p></li>
<li><p>Philo of Alexandria quote frequently from the Old Testament, but never mentioned the Apocryphal books, and never quoted&nbsp;them.</p></li>
<li><p>They are not found in any catalog of canonical books made during the first four&nbsp;centuries.</p></li>
<li><p>Jerome declared for the strict Hebrew canon and rejected the authority of the entire&nbsp;Apocrypha.</p></li>
<li><p>None of the writers of the Apocrypha claim divine inspiration; some of them even deny they were&nbsp;inspired.</p></li>
<li><p>The books contain many historical, chronological, and geographical errors, distortions of Old Testament narratives, and contradict the Bible, secular history, and&nbsp;themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>No prophets were connected with the&nbsp;Apocrypha.</p></li>
<li><p>They teach doctrines and practices which are directly opposed to the canon of&nbsp;Scripture.</p></li>
<li><p>The books were written much later than the Old Testament and after the Hebrew canon was closed in about 425&nbsp;BC.</p></li>
<li><p>The Apocrypha was not permitted to be read for instruction by any organization or group, until the Roman Catholic Council of Trent did so in 1546, and then by a small&nbsp;majority.</p></li>
<li><p>While there are Targums for the Hebrew canon, there are no Targums for the&nbsp;Apocrypha.</p></li>
