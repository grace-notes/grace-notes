<p>The advanced Christian, the person who has &#x201C;attained to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ,&#x201D; has completed basic preparation, is <strong>standing</strong> firm, and is ready to be promoted into mature production in the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 15:57,58.</strong>but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not <em>in</em>vain in the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 16:8.</strong>I have set the Lord always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I shall not be&nbsp;moved.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 21:7.</strong>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses. But we will remember the name of the Lord our God. They are brought down and fallen; but we are risen, and stand&nbsp;upright.</p>

<p><strong>Eph. 4:14-16.</strong>As a result, we are no longer to be children, tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, by craftiness in deceitful&nbsp;scheming;</p>
<p>but speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all <em>aspects</em>into Him who is the head, <em>even</em>Christ,</p>
<p>from whom the whole body, being fitted and held together by what every joint supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for the building up of itself in&nbsp;love.</p>

<p><strong>Eph. 6:10-17.</strong>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His&nbsp;might.</p>
<p>Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the&nbsp;devil.</p>
<p>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual <em>forces</em>of wickedness in the heavenly <em>places.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist in the evil day, and having done everything, to stand&nbsp;firm.</p>
<p>Stand firm therefore, having girded your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of&nbsp;righteousness,</p>
<p>and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of&nbsp;peace;</p>
<p>in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil <em>one.</em></p>
<p>And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>Additional Bible references to the doctrine of&nbsp;standing:</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 66:8,9.</strong>Bless our God, O peoples, And sound His praise&nbsp;abroad,</p>
<p>Who keeps us in life And does not allow our feet to&nbsp;slip.</p>
<p><strong>Prov. 10:30.</strong>The righteous will never be shaken, But the wicked will not dwell in the&nbsp;land.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 11:23.</strong>Then when he arrived and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and <em>began</em>to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain <em>true</em>to the&nbsp;Lord;</p>
<p><strong>2 Thess. 2:15.</strong> So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught, whether by word <em>of mouth</em>or by letter from&nbsp;us.</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 3:6.</strong>but Christ <em>was faithful</em>as a Son over His house&#x2014;whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 10:23.</strong> Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is&nbsp;faithful;</p>
