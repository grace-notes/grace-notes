<p>We don&#x2019;t know much in detail about eternity, what it&#x2019;s like, or what we will be doing there. However, the Bible does have some information from which we can draw some&nbsp;inferences.</p>
<p><strong>The Eternal State of Believers and&nbsp;Unbelievers</strong></p>
<p>Man&#x2019;s relationship to God is one of creature to Creator. God is sovereign over the whole human race by virtue of creation, whether this is acknowledged by people or&nbsp;not.</p>
<p><strong>Jer. 32:27.</strong>Behold, I am the Lord, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for&nbsp;Me?</p>
<p>However, God is <strong>not</strong> the Father of the human race, only of those who&nbsp;believe.</p>
<p><strong>Gal. 3:26.</strong> For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ&nbsp;Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Man is a living soul; and all souls belong to&nbsp;God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gen.&#xA0;2:7.</strong>Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living&nbsp;being.</p>
<p><strong>Ezek. 18:4.</strong>Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is&nbsp;Mine.</p>
<p>A person&#x2019;s eternal relationship to God is based on that person&#x2019;s response to God&#x2019;s offer of salvation by faith in Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p><strong>John 3:36.</strong> He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are two types of people in the human race: believers and unbelievers; saved souls and unsaved souls. And there are two destinations for people in&nbsp;eternity.</p>
<p>A place of&nbsp;bliss:</p>
<p><strong>John 14:1-3.</strong>Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in&nbsp;Me.</p>
<p>In My Father&#x2019;s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, <em>there</em>you may be&nbsp;also.</p>
<p><strong>Rev.&#xA0;21:1-22</strong></p>
<p>A place of&nbsp;torment:</p>
<p><strong>Rev.&#xA0;20:15.</strong>And if anyone&#x2019;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of&nbsp;fire.</p>
<p><strong>Luke&nbsp;16:19-31</strong></p>
<p><strong>The saved soul&nbsp;anticipates</strong></p>
<p><strong>A resurrection to&nbsp;life.</strong></p>
<p><strong>John 5:28,29.</strong>Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His&nbsp;voice,</p>
<p>and will come forth; those who did the good <em>deeds</em>to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil <em>deeds</em>to a resurrection of&nbsp;judgment.</p>
<p><strong>A &#x201C;far better&nbsp;place&#x201D;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phil. 1:23.</strong>But I am hard-pressed from both <em>directions,</em> having the desire to depart and be with Christ, for <em>that</em>is very much&nbsp;better;</p>
<p><strong>Eternity in the presence of&nbsp;God.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 Cor. 5:8.</strong> we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p><strong>An inheritance reserved in&nbsp;heaven.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Peter 1:3,4.</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the&nbsp;dead,</p>
<p>to <em>obtain</em>an inheritance <em>which is</em> imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for&nbsp;you,</p>
<p><strong>Reunion with loved ones in the&nbsp;Lord.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Thess. 4:16,17.</strong>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of <em>the</em>archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<section id="the-lost-soul-must-look-forward-to" class="level4">
<h4><a href="/topics/eternity.html#the-lost-soul-must-look-forward-to">The lost soul must look forward to&nbsp;&#x2026;</a></h4>
<p>An eternity without Christ (separation from&nbsp;God).</p>
<p><strong>The &#x201C;resurrection of&nbsp;damnation&#x201D;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>John 5:28,29.</strong>Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His&nbsp;voice,</p>
<p>and will come forth; those who did the good <em>deeds</em>to a resurrection of life, those who committed the evil <em>deeds</em>to a resurrection of&nbsp;judgment.</p>
<p><strong>The Lake of&nbsp;Fire</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt. 25:41. T</strong>hen He will also say to those on His left, &#x2018;Depart from Me, accursed ones, into the eternal fire which has been prepared for the devil and his&nbsp;angels;</p>
<p><strong>Rev.&#xA0;20:15.</strong>And if anyone&#x2019;s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of&nbsp;fire.</p>
<p><strong>Rev.&#xA0;21:8</strong></p>
<p><strong>Characteristics of the Eternal&nbsp;State</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Jesus Christ will be present and accessible to&nbsp;all</p></li>
<li><p>Perfect&nbsp;happiness</p></li>
<li><p>Perpetual&nbsp;newness</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There will be nations in eternity as a memorial to the Grace of God in preserving the human race so hey could be born-again. Nationalism is the basic principle of survival for the human&nbsp;race.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem (which comes from God) arrives as a complete package. Apparently it is suspended above Earth. The New Jerusalem is headquarters for the universe of eternity, and it is the personal residence of the Lord Jesus Christ. The New Jerusalem fulfills a promise to Abraham that is still outstanding. Abraham lived in a tent, died in a tent, and was promised a city in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 11:9,10.</strong> By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign <em>land</em>, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same&nbsp;promise;</p>
<p>for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>The Holy City of eternity illustrates something of the glory of eternity. The description of the New Jerusalem is in <strong>Rev.&#xA0;21:9 to 22:5</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Believer&#x2019;s Hope in&nbsp;Eternity</strong></p>
<p>The believer&#x2019;s hope is based on the fact that we know facts concerning eternity. For example, we will be absent from the body and face-to-face with the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2 Cor. 5:7,8.</strong> for we walk by faith, not by&nbsp;sight</p>
<p>we are of good courage, I say, and prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p><strong>There is no judgment for the sins of&nbsp;believers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rom. 8:1.</strong>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ&nbsp;Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>The appointment of the 2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong>Death is&nbsp;cancelled.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heb. 9:27,28.</strong>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this <em>comes</em>judgment,</p>
<p>so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without <em>reference to</em>sin, to those who eagerly await&nbsp;Him.</p>
<p><strong>We have a new home; a new dwelling&nbsp;place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>John 14:1-3.</strong> Do not let your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in&nbsp;Me.</p>
<p>In My Father&#x2019;s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, <em>there</em>you may be&nbsp;also.</p>
<p><strong>We have an eternal&nbsp;inheritance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Peter 1:3-5.</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the&nbsp;dead,</p>
<p>to <em>obtain</em>an inheritance <em>which is</em> imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for&nbsp;you,</p>
<p>who are protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>We will have no more sorrow, no more&nbsp;tears.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rev.&#xA0;21:4.</strong>and He will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be <em>any</em>death; there will no longer be <em>any</em>mourning, or crying, or pain; the first things have passed&nbsp;away.&#x201D;</p>
<p><strong>We will have a resurrection body in which we will live with Jesus Christ&nbsp;forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Thess. 4:16-18.</strong> For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of <em>the</em>archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore comfort one another with these&nbsp;words.</p>
<p><strong>Phil. 3:21.</strong>who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of His glory, by the exertion of the power that He has even to subject all things to&nbsp;Himself.</p>
<p><strong>1 John&nbsp;3:1,2</strong></p>
<p><strong>1 Cor.&nbsp;15:51-57</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phil. 1:21.</strong> For to me, to live is Christ and to die is&nbsp;gain.</p>
