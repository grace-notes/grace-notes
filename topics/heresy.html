<p>The words heresy and apostasy are two of the most often used words to refer to doctrinal error and practice in the church&nbsp;age.</p>
<p>Any Christian is subject to error in his thinking about spiritual matters. The presence of the sin nature in the soul guarantees that we will have a constant battle to distinguish between human and divine viewpoints. Error may be the result of ignorance, of a lack of doctrine, or of deliberately adopting some point of view or&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p>The open minded Christian who is positive to the teaching of the Bible and who is willing for the Lord to deal with him in doctrinal matters will find that his erroneous ideas will be replaced with the truth of the word of God. As he grows in Christ, he will avoid heresy and any deliberate&nbsp;apostasy.</p>
<p>Heresy itself, which is the result of making a wrong choice among competing ideas, may have been entered into as a result of being deceived (Eph. 4:17-25) or of falling into a snare of Satan. Heresy becomes apostasy, however, whenever a person deliberately decides to re&#xAD;ject Bible truth and maintain and promote false ideas. This paper is written to help believers avoid error, heresy, or&nbsp;apostasy.</p>
<section id="heresy" class="level5">
<h5><a href="/topics/heresy.html#heresy">Heresy</a></h5>
<p>The word heresy comes from the Greek &#xF061;&#xF069;&#xF072;&#xF065;&#xF073;&#xF069;&#xF056; (<strong>hairesis</strong>) meaning, a choice; a tak&#xAD;ing for oneself; a sect or school of philoso&#xAD;phy. Hence, in the Bible, it means (1) a cho&#xAD;sen course of thought or action; (2) dissensions arising from diversity of opinions and aims; or (3) doctrinal departures from revealed truth or erroneous doctrinal&nbsp;views.</p>
<p>The apostles warned the church continu&#xAD;ously against such non Biblical views. Note particularly the stern directions to Titus regard&#xAD;ing the correction of problems caused in Crete by Judaistic&nbsp;heresies.</p>
<p>In the apostolic age we find three funda&#xAD;mental forms of heresy. These have appeared in one form or another in every&nbsp;generation.</p>
</section>
<section id="judaism" class="level5">
<h5><a href="/topics/heresy.html#judaism">Judaism</a></h5>
<p>Judaism is the false counterpart of Jewish Christianity which insists on combining Jewish practice with Christianity. This tends to cause Christianity to sink to the level of Judaism in that it makes the gospel merely the perfection which they suppose can be obtained by keep&#xAD;ing the Law. Judaism regards Christ as a mere prophet, a second Moses; it denies His divine nature, His priestly function and His kingly&nbsp;offices.</p>
<p>Judaism holds that circumcision, sacrifice, etc. are to be binding on Christians and neces&#xAD;sary for salvation. There is no conception of Christianity as a new, free, and universal reli&#xAD;gion. Judaism appears in the second century A.D. in a more fully developed version under the name of&nbsp;Ebionism.</p>
</section>
<section id="gnosticism" class="level5">
<h5><a href="/topics/heresy.html#gnosticism">Gnosticism</a></h5>
<p>Gnosticism spread through the whole church during the first two or three centuries after Christ. This heresy was an opposite re&#xAD;action to Judaism. It separated Christianity completely from Jewish influence with the re&#xAD;sult that it tried to eliminate any connection to the true historical foundations of Christianity. Gnosticism denies the humanity of Christ, and it adulterates Christianity with pagan ideas and&nbsp;practices.</p>
</section>
<section id="syncretism" class="level5">
<h5><a href="/topics/heresy.html#syncretism">Syncretism</a></h5>
<p>Syncretism combines Judaism, and then Christianity, with heathen philosophies, espe&#xAD;cially those of Pythagoras and Plato, so that, under the Christian name, there appeared con&#xAD;fused combinations of these opposing systems, forming either a paganized Judaism or a Christianized paganism, depending on which element&nbsp;prevailed.</p>
<p>Whatever the differences in the heresies, all amount to a distinct denial of the gospel, the incarnation of the son of God for the sal&#xAD;vation of the world. They make Christ either a mere man or a mere superhuman phantom; they allow no real and lasting union of the divine and human natures in the person of the redeemer. Heresy disturbed the unity of doc&#xAD;trine and of fellowship in the early church, which was therefore forced to exclude those holding false doctrine from it communion (Titus 3:10). Once excluded, however, heretics formed societies of their&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>Heresy becomes apostasy when there is a deliberate holding to error in spite of knowing the truth of the word of God. A heretic be&#xAD;comes apostate at the point when he hears the truth and decides against&nbsp;it.</p>
</section>
<section id="apostasy" class="level5">
<h5><a href="/topics/heresy.html#apostasy">Apostasy</a></h5>
<p>Apostasy is the deliberate act of a profess&#xAD;ing Christian who knowingly and deliberately rejects revealed truth regarding the deity of Jesus Christ, redemption through His atoning sacrifice, or any part of the doctrines related to salvation. The apostate is in revolt against God. He maintains an outward profession of faith and a facade of true spirituality; but he departs from the faith. Apostasy, then, is in&#xAD;sidious, subtle and quite&nbsp;devastating.</p>
<p>Some of the characteristics, or synonyms, of apostasy are mentioned in the Bible, includ&#xAD;ing: seducing spirits, doctrines of demons, hypocritical lying, a seared conscience, forbid&#xAD;ding of marriage and meats, and a form of godliness without the power. The rest of this paper contains a number of points about apostasy along with an extensive listing of Bible references for further study of the&nbsp;subject.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Satan is the author of apostasy, John 8:44, &#x201C;Ye are of your father, the devil&#x2026;&#x201D; and 2 Cor. 4:4, &#x201C;In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which be&#xAD;lieve not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine unto&nbsp;them.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>Demons help to carry out apostasy in the world, 1 Tim.&nbsp;4:1.</p></li>
<li><p>Examples of apostasy in the human race mentioned in Jude&nbsp;are:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Cain - who rejected the word of God and went&nbsp;religious.</p>
<p>Balaam - who accepted a bribe to curse Israel and fell victim to slavery to the de&#xAD;tails of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Korah - who led a revolt against authority, was&nbsp;antiestablishment.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Religious apostasy has many&nbsp;facets:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Characteristics of apostate&nbsp;doctrines:</li>
</ol>
<p>They repudiate the person and work of Christ, 2 Pet. 2:1; 1 John 2:22, 23; 2 John 9,&nbsp;10</p>
<p>They repudiate the veracity of the word of God, 2 Pet. 3:3,&nbsp;4</p>
<p>They ignore the judgments of God, 2 Pet. 3:5,&nbsp;6</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>Apostasy appeals to the trends of the sin nature; the trend toward asceticism, 1 Tim. 4:1&#x2013;3, and the trend toward licentiousness, 2 Pet.&nbsp;2</p></li>
<li><p>Apostasy is judged by&nbsp;God:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Civilizations are judged for apostasy, 2 Pet.&nbsp;2:5.</p>

<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Apostates are described in the Bible&nbsp;as:</li>
</ol>
<p>Animals of instinct, minus doctrine, minus morality, operating on emotional impulses and licentious desires, 2 Pet.&nbsp;2:12.</p>
<p>Fruitless trees that are twice dead; they are spiritually dead and they will be uprooted, Jude&nbsp;12.</p>
<p>Waterless clouds, unstable, driven by the wind, 2 Pet. 2:17; Jude&nbsp;12.</p>
<p>Vicious waves of the sea, dangerous and to be avoided, Jude&nbsp;13.</p>
<p>Wandering stars, living in delusion and er&#xAD;ror, Jude&nbsp;13.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Apostasy is prevalent in the last days of each&nbsp;dispensation:</li>
</ol>
<p>Age of the Gentiles,&nbsp;Gen.&#xA0;11:1&#x2013;9.</p>
<p>Age of Israel, Rev.&#xA0;13; 2 Thess.&nbsp;2</p>
<p>Church age, 2 Pet. 3:3; 2 Tim.&nbsp;3:1.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>Apostasy is prevalent in the last days of a national entity, Jer.&nbsp;23:9&#x2013;40.</p></li>
<li><p>There will be no apostasy during the millennial kingdom, Rev.&#xA0;20:1-3; Zech. 13:2, 3; Isa. 2:1&#x2013;4; Isa.&nbsp;11:9.</p></li>
<li><p>A brief period of apostasy will follow the millennial reign of Christ,&nbsp;Rev.&#xA0;20:7&#x2013;11.</p></li>
