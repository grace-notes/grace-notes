<p>The rabbis of the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> centuries after Christ organized the Talmud in the form we find it today. Rabbi Jehudah the Nasi (3<sup>rd</sup> Century, president of the Sanhedrin) began the work of gathering together all the notes, archives, and records from which the Talmud would be compiled. The scholars in Spain asserted that these notes had been in existence since schools had begun in Israel, possibly from as early as Ezra&#x2019;s&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Other Jewish scholars of that period, notably those living in France, declared that not a line was written down anywhere until this compilation began, and that the writing was done from memory alone, the memory of the living rabbis who were the&nbsp;contributors.</p>
<p>Modern scholars have compromised between these two versions of how things happened, by asserting that, during the first centuries, the commentators of the Talmud had taken notes of their studies, then later had written them out in permanent&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>It was severe persecution that was the strong motivation to write things down. The very lives of the scholars were threatened continuously in some periods, and the thought of important bodies of thought perishing with one or two individuals was a catalyst that lead to written&nbsp;transcripts.</p>
<p>At a certain point, probably during the 2<sup>nd</sup> century after Christ, the Pharisees gave permission for writing the law. Until then it was absolutely forbidden to put the oral law in writing. No sooner had this been granted that the number of manuscripts began to be very great, and when Rabbi Jehudah had been confirmed in authority (since he enjoyed the friendship of a Roman named Antonius, who was in power in Rome), he discovered that &#x201C;from the multitude of the trees the forest could not be&nbsp;seen.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The period of the 3<sup>rd</sup> century was very favorable for this undertaking, because the Talmud, and its Jewish followers, enjoyed a rest from persecutors. But there were still sharp differences of opinion among the students of the Talmud&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>Although Rabban Gamaliel the Elder (the Gamaliel of the New Testament) had succeeded in fixing the Law in accordance with Hillel&#x2019;s school, and had declared, with the consent of many of the most prestigious sages of the Talmud, that the school of Schammai was of no validity, when it differed from Hillel, there were more than 400 students in his college alone. So it was decided the individual opinions, even those of the minority, should be considered; and differences between schools of thought were renewed with considerable vigor. Thus, when Rabbi Jehudah began his compilation, he was compelled to give due weight to all the varying&nbsp;opinions.</p>
<p>Another difficulty was in selecting from the mass of doctrines, laws, and commentaries those which were practicable and of direct application. One Rabbi&#x2019;s account states that there were more than 600 sections of Mishnah, and even if this is an exaggeration, it was no easy task to reduce them to&nbsp;six.</p>

<p>This section (7 tractates, 71 chapters) deals with laws regarding women, marriage, and divorce. There also laws on vows and Nazarites, because women&#x2019;s vows are dependent on the decision of their fathers and husbands; and Nazarites depend on women, who may legally consecrate a child previous to its birth, as for example, Hannah, the mother of Samuel, and the mother of&nbsp;Samson.</p>
<p>Tract <strong>Yebamot</strong> &#x2013; Levirate marriage; prohibitions on marriage; testimony on the death of the&nbsp;husband.</p>

Another tractate, <strong>Horayot</strong> (Decisions), deals with the problem of what to do in case the Sanhedrin makes an erroneous decision that plunges the whole nation into error. The tractate <strong>Avot</strong> (Fathers) deals with ethics and philosophy and contains the sayings and aphorisms of sages of the Mishnah. Because of this unique content, this tractate was included in may prayer books and was translated into other&nbsp;languages.</p>
<p>Tract <strong>Baba Kama</strong> (First Gate) &#x2013; direct and indirect&nbsp;damages.</p>
<p>Tract <strong>Baba Metzia</strong> (Middle Gate) &#x2013; losses, loans, work, and wage&nbsp;contracts.</p>

<section id="seder-toharot-purity" class="level2">
<h2><a href="/topics/talmud-organization.html#seder-toharot-purity">Seder Toharot&nbsp;(Purity)</a></h2>
<p>This section (12 tractates, 126 chapters) includes the most complex and involved legal subjects, the laws of ritual purity and impurity. These laws, which were observed mainly in the period of the Temple, and for several subsequent generations in Palestine, consist of minute and extremely involved details based on ancient traditions, in which the logical connection is not always discernible. One tractate, <strong>Nidah</strong>, the only one which appears in either the Jerusalem or Babylonian Talmud, has practical significance in that it discusses laws on the periodic ritual uncleanness of&nbsp;women.</p>
