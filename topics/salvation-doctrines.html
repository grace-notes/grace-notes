<p><em>“The Christian who does not understand what God has done in the past, and does not have faith in what God will do in the future, will be overwhelmed by today’s crisis.”</em> <strong>Chester&nbsp;McCalley</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your Christian life began the moment you believed the Gospel, putting your complete confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ for salvation. At that moment, God provided you with a great number of unique and permanent blessings. <em>“…and hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ.”</em> (Eph. 1:3) These blessings are a part of your inheritance as a Christian; they are the doctrines and promises upon which you may draw during the remainder of your&nbsp;lifetime.</p>
<p>The following is a listing of salvation doctrines, a catalogue of the things God did for you when you accepted Christ. These basic teachings are the underlying principles for the mechanics of Christian living, the techniques such as faith rest and occupation with Christ, and are foundation principles for all other Bible&nbsp;doctrine.</p>
<p>This listing can provide you with hours of quality study and meditation. You may well find other topics that could be added to the list. It is valuable and important that you understand thoroughly your relationship with the Lord; a good knowledge of these doctrines can be of great help to you in solving problems and making decisions according to God’s&nbsp;viewpoint.</p>

This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the sins previously committed; for the demonstration, I say, of His righteousness at the present time, so that He would be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith. For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.</em>”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1 John 2:2</strong>. “<em>and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.</em>”</p></li>

<ul>
