          <section class="content"><p>I met Ethel at church in Kansas City, in 1952; we were 18. She was then already a master of the details of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Ethel had accepted Christ at 16, and had immediately begun studying the Bible, learning and absorbing the teachings of Bible doctrine, virtually memorizing epistles and other large portions of Scripture. We got married in 1955; from then until now, Ethel’s life has been one of the continuous application of Bible doctrine to the details of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>It’s easy to “master” the details of life when one is prosperous. It is when hard times come, and details of life are lost, that a Christian’s true mettle is seen. During those 60 years since I met Ethel, I have observed her spiritual responses in times of both privation and relative&nbsp;prosperity.</p>
<p>During hard times, Ethel has always trusted the Lord to provide. When she was hurt or offended, she did not fume and seethe, backbite, malign, or cast blame. Instead, she would grow quiet in order to pray, recall Bible promises, claim the promises (faith-rest), quickly recover a relaxed mental attitude, forgive the offenders (most often me), and be restored quickly to her usual condition of joy and cheerfulness. She never yelled at me or the children, she never asked for anything for herself, was always focused on the needs of&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Ethel’s testimony has always been one of occupation with Christ, faith-rest, a relaxed mental attitude, and the resulting joy of the&nbsp;Lord.</p>
<p><strong>The Details of&nbsp;Life</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of our Bible studies, we use the term “details of life” to refer to everything that is a part of human life on&nbsp;earth.</p>
<p>Anything that affects our life, or on which our life is contingent, is a detail of life. An exhaustive list would be hard to create, but details of life include such things&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your human body, which includes your health, physical fitness,&nbsp;age.</p></li>
<li><p>Your mental capability, e.g. intelligence, education, mental&nbsp;stability.</p></li>
<li><p>Necessities of life: food, clothing, shelter,&nbsp;transportation.</p></li>
<li><p>Human love, marriage and sex, and family&nbsp;life.</p></li>
<li><p>Social life, including your relationships with friends, fellow workers, church&nbsp;family.</p></li>
<li><p>Finances, income, savings, and your financial&nbsp;future.</p></li>
<li><p>Employment: satisfaction with job, sense of accomplishment,&nbsp;etc</p></li>
<li><p>Environment: the country and community you live in, the weather, the comfort of your&nbsp;surroundings.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I know you could add many things to these, but this list is&nbsp;representative.</p>
<p><strong>Human&nbsp;Happiness</strong></p>
<p>Now the details of life can sometimes provide a measure of satisfaction and happiness, but only in the sense of human&nbsp;happiness.</p>
<p>When one has enough money, for example, there is a sense of relaxation and satisfaction. There is relief, as least for a while, of the fear of poverty, of not being able to pay bills, of being able to purchase things you want. We will call this good feeling “human&nbsp;happiness.”</p>
<p>Good health also provides “human happiness”; if you feel well, if you aren’t in pain, if you can exercise and work without physical problems, you may have a feeling of well-being and satisfaction with your&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Likewise, when you have a good marriage and social life, with compatible friends, easy relationships with people, etc., you are happy with those&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p>If your employment also is providing you with satisfaction, and you feel you are contributing to society, that makes you feel good,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Human happiness depends upon one or more details of life to sustain it. Therefore, human happiness is <strong><em>temporary</em></strong> and <strong><em>dependent</em></strong>. It lasts only as long as it is supported by the details that provide the&nbsp;happiness.</p>
<p>Human happiness begins to be diminished, or disappears completely, when the details that support that happiness are no longer&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><strong>The Loss of Human Happiness&nbsp;(Suffering)</strong></p>
<p>One way of describing suffering is to say that it comes from the removal of some form of human happiness. Suffering is the loss of some of the details of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>Suffering can occur several ways, both for Christians and unbelievers, including the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Suffering by loss of health - physical pain, illness, accident, loss of function,&nbsp;etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Suffering by privation - the lack of something necessary such as money, food, shelter, clothing,&nbsp;transportation.</p></li>
<li><p>Suffering from the weather - freezing weather or hot, storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, as well as earthquakes,&nbsp;volcanoes.</p></li>
<li><p>Suffering from mental anguish - worry, sorrow, anguish, fears, phobias, bitterness, jealousy, not the least of which is “suffering by&nbsp;anticipation”.</p></li>
<li><p>Suffering from justice, the long arm of the law, deserved or&nbsp;undeserved.</p></li>
<li><p>Suffering caused by other people. As long as there are two people in the same location…well, you know what I&nbsp;mean.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Joy (Divine&nbsp;Happiness)</strong></p>
<p>God’s happiness (joy) is <em>independent</em> of anything in this world. The Bible says that it is possible, “to be content in whatsoever state I am”, that is, to have a deep inner happiness and contentment that does not depend on other people, material possessions, or&nbsp;circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Joy is not dependent on the details of&nbsp;life!</p></li>
<li><p>You can see, then, that if a person possesses God’s joy (+H), the loss of human happiness is much more&nbsp;tolerable.</p></li>
<li><p>When you are a master of the details of life, <strong>your happiness does not depend on people, circumstances, or things</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>You have the peace of God that passes&nbsp;understanding.</p></li>
<li><p>You have learned to be content under any&nbsp;circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>You can wait for the Lord’s timing in providing the details you want; you can enjoy them when you have&nbsp;them.</p></li>
<li><p>You can remain happy when the Lord sees fit not to provide some&nbsp;detail.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mastery of the details of life means that you look to the Lord for every detail, that you accept with calm fortitude either the gain or loss of details of&nbsp;life.</strong></p>
<p>We are all involved with details of life. Either we master them, or they master us! If you are a slave to one or more details of life, your thoughts are devoted to them, and they drive you. They dominate your thoughts, your conversation, your decisions. Slavery to the details of life leads to disillusion, disappointment, and&nbsp;depression.</p>
<p>Inner happiness is not possible for the believer who so occupied with himself and his needs or desires that he ignores God’s plan. Inner happiness is a state of rejoicing based on knowing that God is everything He claims to be and that He can do what He has promised. Inner happiness is the joy of living where every provision for physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being is being made by God in the life of a Christian who is walking in daily fellowship with&nbsp;Him.</p>
<p>There are many Bible teachings which contribute to a Christian’s being able to have mastery of the details of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>The following is a list of many of the Bible doctrine topics that contribute to a person’s having mastery of the details of life. <strong>Your mastery of the details of life depends on your learning and applying these principles of Bible&nbsp;doctrine.</strong></p>
