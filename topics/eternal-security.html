<p><strong>Introduction <sup><a href="/topics/eternal-security.html#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></sup></strong></p>
<p>There are two biblical concepts which contribute to a Christian&#x2019;s having a sure grasp of&nbsp;salvation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Assurance: &#x201C;I know I am saved&nbsp;now.&#x201D;</p></li>
<li><p>Security: &#x201C;I know I am saved now and&nbsp;forever.&#x201D;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An understanding of these concepts is required before there can be stability in our Christian&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>Think, for example, how a child&#x2019;s knowledge of his place in his family contributes to a sense of safety and well-being. Furthermore, a good parent would never discipline a child by threatening the family relationship. Much more does God the Father assure us of our permanent relationship in His family; even the chastisement He metes out assures us that we are His true children, not&nbsp;illegitimate.</p>
<p>Three reasons genuine believers sometimes doubt their&nbsp;salvation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some Christians look inward to feelings. But feelings are never a criterion for truth. Basing assurance on how we feel is no more secure than the human emotions we have at the&nbsp;moment.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Christians are confused about life after salvation, about what the Lord provides for believers who commit sins and become carnal, out of fellowship. They do not know that one can be a genuine Christians and yet carnal, as in 1 Cor.&nbsp;3:1.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Christians have never really understood what God the Father has provided at the time of Salvation. They do not grasp the problem involved in God&#x2019;s providing salvation, therefore how impossible it is for any human being to make any contribution to the solution for the problem of sin. These Christians do not see that the solution to the sin problem lies <strong>totally with God</strong>. Man cannot contribute anything to the solution; man can do nothing at all to accomplish any aspect of his own&nbsp;salvation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Topic: Salvation&nbsp;Doctrines</p>
<p>The problem in providing mankind with salvation&nbsp;is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>God is righteous; therefore He demands 100% perfection. (Rom.&nbsp;3:23).</p></li>
<li><p>God is just, so He must release His full wrath on sin (Rom.&nbsp;6:23).</p></li>
<li><p>Yet, God is love and wants to save us (John&nbsp;3:16).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to see how these three ideas can be brought into&nbsp;harmony.</p>
<p>Every person who lacks assurance harbors the thought, somewhere in the back of his mind, that he must make some contribution towards solving the problems of sin and alienation from God. He thinks that salvation is 90% God&#x2019;s and 10% his part. He can never rest because he can never be sure he has accomplished his&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>Any program that man devises can never be depended upon. Assurance of salvation is only possible when a person is confident that God is the provider of salvation &#x2013;&nbsp;100%.</p>
<p><strong>Approaches to Understanding&nbsp;Security</strong></p>
<p>Our salvation is based on the <strong>divine purpose</strong> of God. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit all contribute to our&nbsp;salvation.</p>
<p><em><em>It is the Father&#x2019;s purpose to save&nbsp;us.</em></em></p>
<p><strong>Rom. 8:28-30.</strong> <em>And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to <em>His</em>purpose.</em></p>
<p><em>For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined <em>to become</em>conformed to the image of His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many&nbsp;brethren;</em></p>
<p><em>and these whom He predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also&nbsp;glorified.</em></p>
<p>God&#x2019;s purpose is introduced in Rom. 8:28, then explained in verses 29 and 30. Notice that the same people who are <em>justified</em> are the ones who are <em>glorified</em>. Notice further that the word <em>glorified</em> is in the past tense. In the plan of God we are already glorified! Therefore, if anyone who was genuinely saved, losing that salvation would mean a failure of the specific purpose of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p><em><em>It is the Father&#x2019;s power that saves&nbsp;us.</em></em></p>
<p><strong>John 10:27-29.</strong> <em>My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow&nbsp;Me;</em></p>
<p><em>and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My&nbsp;hand.</em></p>
<p><em>My Father, who has given <em>them</em>to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch <em>them</em> out of the Father&#x2019;s&nbsp;hand.</em></p>
<p><em>A believer is held by (1) God the Son&#x2019;s hand, and (2) God the Father&#x2019;s hand; we can never be let&nbsp;go.</em></p>
<p>This passage refers to people who have accepted Christ, the Lord says &#x201C;<em>My sheep&#x2026;</em>&#x201D;. In verse 29 we wee that security rests in God&#x2019;s ability to &#x201C;hold on&#x201D; to believers, <strong>not</strong> in a person&#x2019;s ability to &#x201C;hold on&#x201D; to God. To question that security is to question this promise, and to question God&#x2019;s&nbsp;ability.</p>
<p><em><em>God promises to save all who&nbsp;believe.</em></em></p>
<p><strong>John 5:24.</strong>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into&nbsp;life.</p>
<p><em><em>What is possessed in salvation? Eternal&nbsp;life!</em></em></p>
<p>When does possession of this life take place? It takes place <strong>now</strong>. The one who believes in Christ <strong>has</strong> eternal&nbsp;life.</p>
<section id="salvation-is-linked-to-the-sons-prayer." class="level4">
<h4><a href="/topics/eternal-security.html#salvation-is-linked-to-the-sons-prayer.">Salvation is linked to the Son&#x2019;s&nbsp;prayer.</a></h4>
<p><strong>John 17:11-15.</strong>I am no longer in the world; and <em>yet</em> they themselves are in the world, and I come to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name, <em>the name</em> which You have given Me, that they may be one even as We <em>are.</em></p>
<p>While I was with them, I was keeping them in Your name which You have given Me; and I guarded them and not one of them perished but the son of perdition, so that the Scripture would be&nbsp;fulfilled.</p>
<p>But now I come to You; and these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>I do not ask You to take them out of the world, but to keep them from the evil <em>one.</em></p>
<p>The Son petitions the Father to keep believers. Believers are seen as having been given by the Father to the Son. No &#x201C;given one&#x201D; is ever lost; otherwise the Father would have to &#x201C;take back&#x201D; the gift He made to&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p>Salvation is linked to the <strong>Son&#x2019;s work</strong>, both in terms of His death (1 John 2:1) and also in terms of His continuous advocacy for us (1 John 2:2). Our security rests in the prayer and work of God the&nbsp;Son.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 2:1,2.</strong>My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the&nbsp;righteous;</p>
<p>and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for <em>those of</em>the whole&nbsp;world.</p>

<section id="the-presence-of-the-holy-spirit-brings-security." class="level4">
<h4><a href="/topics/eternal-security.html#the-presence-of-the-holy-spirit-brings-security.">The presence of the Holy Spirit brings&nbsp;security.</a></h4>
<p><strong>John 14:16.</strong>I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you&nbsp;forever;</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit will be with us permanently; since it is eternal, it cannot be&nbsp;terminated.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit&#x2019;s work if a guarantee of security. We are sealed &#x201C;until the day of redemption&#x201D;. The seal of the Holy Spirit is a sign of possession and protection. The seal is described as an &#x201C;earnest&#x201D; or &#x201C;down payment&#x201D; on a future guarantee of eternal&nbsp;life.</p>
<p><strong>Eph. 1:13,14.</strong>In Him, you also, after listening to the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation&#x2014;having also believed, you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of&nbsp;promise,</p>
<p>who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to the redemption of <em>God&#x2019;s own</em>possession, to the praise of His&nbsp;glory.</p>
<p><strong>Eph. 4:30.</strong>Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of&nbsp;redemption.</p>
<p><strong>2 Cor. 1:21,22.</strong>Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is&nbsp;God,</p>
<p>who also sealed us and gave <em>us</em>the Spirit in our hearts as a&nbsp;pledge.</p>

<h4><a href="/topics/eternal-security.html#believers-are-in-union-with-christ">Believers are in Union with&nbsp;Christ</a></h4>
<p><strong>Rom. 8:1.</strong>Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ&nbsp;Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Eph. 1:3-6.</strong>Blessed <em>be</em>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly <em>places</em>in&nbsp;Christ,</p>
<p>just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In&nbsp;love</p>
<p>He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His&nbsp;will,</p>
<p>to the praise of the glory of His grace, which He freely bestowed on us in the&nbsp;Beloved.</p>
<p>Union with Christ (positional truth) is irreversible. It is ludicrous to think that believers can somehow pop in and out of our position in&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>God did the most for us when we were His enemies, how &#x201C;much more&#x201D; will He do for us now that we are in His&nbsp;family?</p>
<p><strong>Rom. 5:9,10.</strong>Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath <em>of God</em> through&nbsp;Him.</p>
<p>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His&nbsp;life.</p>
<p><strong>Rom. 5:17.</strong>For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Rom. 8:32.</strong> He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him over for us all, how will He not also with Him freely give us all&nbsp;things?</p>

<h4><a href="/topics/eternal-security.html#believers-are-permanent-members-of-the-family-of-god.">Believers are Permanent Members of the Family of&nbsp;God.</a></h4>
<p>In the Bible, there are &#x201C;family&#x201D; terms used for our relationships to one another and to Christ, such as &#x201C;born again&#x201D;, &#x201C;children&#x201D;,&nbsp;&#x201C;brothers&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 2:11-13.</strong>For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one <em>Father;</em> for which reason He is not ashamed to call them&nbsp;brethren,</p>
<p>saying, &#x201C;I will proclaim Your name to My brethren, In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your&nbsp;praise.&#x201D;</p>
<p>And again, &#x201C;I will put My trust in Him.&#x201D; And again, &#x201C;Behold, I and the children whom God has given&nbsp;Me.&#x201D;</p>
<p>As you placed your confidence in Christ for salvation, so place your confidence in God the Father for your eternal preservation in&nbsp;Christ.</p>
