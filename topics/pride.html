<p>Introduction</p>
<p>God has a plan for your life. God is perfect. Therefore, His plan is&nbsp;perfect.</p>
<p>It is impossible for you with your sin nature to execute the plan of God for your life. Therefore, God has provided through His grace a way for you to execute His plan, purpose, and will during your&nbsp;lifetime.</p>
<p>Whenever a Christian fails in executing the plan of God for his life, sinful pride is the primary reason and motivating&nbsp;cause.</p>
<p>Pride is the basic mental attitude sin. As you will see in this study, sinful pride or arrogance precedes and supports all of the sinful mental attitudes the sin nature&nbsp;produces.</p>
<p>Satan was the first creature guilty of pride. His motivation of pride is found in one line of Isa. 14:14, “I will make myself like the Most High God.” The original sin of pride is amplified in the following&nbsp;passage.</p>
<p><strong>Ezek.&nbsp;28:14-17</strong></p>
<p>A Description of Sinful&nbsp;Pride</p>
<p>Pride is a lofty self-respect totally apart from reality. It is high esteem of oneself from some imagined or real&nbsp;superiority.</p>
<p>Pride is the antithesis of grace. The believer who is arrogant is totally blind to the grace of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>Pride is synonymous with vanity, which is empty pride in regard to one’s person, attainments, or possessions coupled with an excessive desire to be noticed, a lust for attention, lust for approval or praise from&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Pride is the pomposity of vain glory. It is supercilious and haughty contempt of&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Pride supports a whole array of sins, such as jealousy, bitterness, vindictiveness, implacability, revenge motivation, revenge tactics, self pity, conceit, inordinate ambition and competition, slander, gossip and&nbsp;maligning.</p>
<p>Pride is a mental attitude sin which overflows into the motivation, decision making and activity of the individual. Pride includes several different&nbsp;concepts.</p>
<p>• Egotism. This is an excessive preoccupation with self and must be distinguished from ego, which is self consciousness and is perfectly&nbsp;normal.</p>
<p>• Vanity. This is self admiration and an excessive desire to be admired by others. Hence, vanity is easily flattered and&nbsp;patronized.</p>
<p>• Conceit. This is exaggerated estimate of one’s abilities and&nbsp;attainments.</p>
<p>Scriptures Related to the Sin of&nbsp;Pride</p>
<p>**Prov. 11:2, “**When pride comes, then come dishonor. But with the humble is&nbsp;wisdom.”</p>
<p>Prov. 16:18, “Pride precedes destruction, And a haughty spirit before&nbsp;stumbling.”</p>
<p><strong>Rom. 12:3,</strong>“For though the grace given to me I say to every man among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of&nbsp;faith.”</p>
<p>Pride is defined in terms of the sin of jealousy&nbsp;in</p>
<p><strong>James 3:14-16,</strong>“But if you have bitter jealousy and inordinate ambition in your heart, stop being arrogant, and stop lying against the truth. This pseudo wisdom is not that which comes from above, but is earthly, natural, and demonic. For where jealousy and inordinate ambition exist there is disorder and every evil&nbsp;deed.”</p>
<p><strong>Prov. 13:10, “<strong>Through pride comes strife, but wisdom is with those who receive instruction</strong>.”</strong></p>
<p>**1 Pet. 5:5, “**Likewise you younger men be subject to the elder , and all of you cloth yourselves with humility toward one another. `For God makes war against the arrogant, but He gives grace to the humble.’ Therefore, humble yourselves under the powerful hand of God, that He may promote you at the proper&nbsp;time.”</p>
<p>Application</p>
<p>If God does not promote you, you are not&nbsp;promoted.</p>
<p>God promotes men and women of who have absorbed the word of&nbsp;God.</p>
<p>God promotes humble or grace oriented&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>Promotion is a matter of doctrinal inculcation and&nbsp;grace-orientation.</p>
<p>Promotion is a matter of glorifying God through the execution of the plan of God for the believer in the church&nbsp;age.</p>
<p>Promoted believers are the invisible heroes of the church&nbsp;age.</p>
<p><strong>2 Tim. 3:2-7</strong>“For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, slanderers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked, without virtue love, malicious gossips, without self control, brutal, not lovers of God, treacherous, thoughtless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but having denied its power, in fact, avoid such persons as these. And among them are those who creep into households and captivates silly women who are loaded down with sins and lead on by their multifarious lusts, always learning but never able to come to metabolized knowledge of the&nbsp;truth.”</p>
<p>The Arrogance of Nations Brings Them Under Divine&nbsp;Discipline</p>
<p><strong>Lev. 26:19, “And I will break down the pride of your power. And I will make your sky like iron and your land like&nbsp;bronze.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isa. 9:8-9,</strong>“The Lord sends a message against Jacob and it falls on Israel. And all the people know it, that is, Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, who spoke with pride and pride of&nbsp;heart.”</p>
<p><strong>Ezek. 7:10,</strong>“Behold, the day is coming. Your doom has gone forth. The rod of discipline has budded because pride has&nbsp;blossomed.”</p>
<p>Pride is Always Related to the Rejection of the Word of&nbsp;God</p>
<p><strong>1 Tim. 6:3-4,</strong>“If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not concur with sound doctrine, those doctrines of our Lord Jesus Christ, even doctrines pertaining to godliness , he has become arrogant, understanding nothing. Furthermore, he has morbid obsessions about controversies and verbal conflicts from which originate jealousy, discord, evil&nbsp;speculation.”</p>
<p>Pride distracts the believer from doctrine. Pride divorces the believer from reality, both personal and historical. Pride is the corruptor of the soul and the sign that the sin nature is dominating the&nbsp;soul.</p>
<p>Pride destroys capacity for life, love and&nbsp;happiness.</p>
<p>The Effects of&nbsp;Pride</p>
<p>The arrogant person rejects&nbsp;authority.</p>
<p>Pride motivates emotional sins, such as: fear, worry, anxiety, hatred, anger, violence, murder, guilt, guilt complex and self&nbsp;pity.</p>
<p>Pride reproduces itself in jealousy, bitterness, vindictiveness, implacability, revenge motivation and function, inordinate ambition and competition, gossip, slander, maligning and&nbsp;judging.</p>
<p>Pride transformed into self righteousness produces&nbsp;legalism.</p>
<p>The Solution to&nbsp;Pride</p>
<p>Occupation with Christ is the ultimate problem solving device regarding pride. Refer to the Grace Notes on Occupation with&nbsp;Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Prov 8:13,</strong> “The respect for the Lord is to hate evil, to hate pride and pride and the evil way. And I hate a perverted&nbsp;mouth.”</p>
<p>Daily attention to the techniques of the Christian way of Life will give you a grace mental attitude that becomes more and more free of pride as you grow in Christ and in the knowledge of His&nbsp;word.</p>
